<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are circumstances in
connection with the publication of this volume which I deem it
necessary to mention.&nbsp; Some persons probably have thought
that such an undertaking should have devolved on an individual
possessing greater literary attainments, and occupying a higher
position in the parish than I do in it.&nbsp; To this impression
I willingly give my assent.&nbsp; But this has not been the case;
and the length of time (upwards of forty years) since the late
Mr. Faulkner published his &ldquo;History of Chelsea,&rdquo; and
the consequent difficulty of procuring a copy&mdash;independently
of the fact that much contained in that work is now altogether
devoid of interest, and also that, from the great improvements
and alterations in the parish, there required many additions to
be made to it&mdash;induced me, in the decline of life, to
undertake the present task.</p>
<p>As an additional justification for the course I have pursued,
it must not be forgotten that Chelsea is my native parish, and
that I have possessed peculiar facilities for acquiring the
necessary information; and, moreover, that in early life I
composed in type a great portion of Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s first
edition, and at a subsequent period was employed as the
printing-office reader of his edition in two volumes.&nbsp; This
gave me frequent opportunities of seeing him, and witnessing his
laborious exertions to produce a work as complete &ldquo;as the
utmost diligence, care, and patience enabled him to
collect.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot but think that these
considerations&mdash;combined with the fact of my having been,
for many years since that period, connected with the press in
London&mdash;will remove all <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>impressions of assumption, on my
part, for submitting the present volume to the impartial judgment
of the parishioners and the public.</p>
<p>I have purposely avoided all dry details of parochial
management, &amp;c., as being foreign to the nature of the work
and rendered now unnecessary in consequence of the voluminous
Annual Vestry Reports, which may easily be obtained.&nbsp; My
object has rather been to make the volume interesting, as far as
possible, without being guilty of &ldquo;book-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work embodies all the essential and interesting
information that could be obtained, with a great amount of
original matter, and should the volume not appear so bulky as
some might have expected, it is simply owing to the rejection of
extraneous subjects.</p>
<p>That the intelligent working-man, and persons of limited
means, might possess the work, I published a certain number of
copies at a very great sacrifice, trusting that the motive would
be rather an inducement than otherwise for others to purchase the
volume.&nbsp; Local histories, unlike other works, can only have
a small circulation, and the price charged for them must be
necessarily regulated by the probable number that will be
sold.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I beg to offer my grateful acknowledgments for
the kindness and assistance which I have received from several
gentlemen, and now submit the result of my labours to the
favourable criticism, and I trust remunerative patronage of the
inhabitants and others interested in a parish which, in many
points of view is unusually interesting and instructive.</p>

Thames.&nbsp; Interspersed with Notices of many of the most
Eminent Residents in the Parish in the &ldquo;Olden Times,&rdquo;
and other Interesting Particulars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord Brougham</span>, in the course of
some remarks on modern English literature, incidentally observed
that &ldquo;local histories were not only interesting to the
residents in the districts to which they referred, but such minor
works would be found of immense value to future national
historians.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was also the avowed opinion of Mr.
Faulkner, when he published his invaluable &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">History of Chelsea</span>,&rdquo; upwards of 40
years since, and my motive in undertaking the present work is to
carry forward the great object which that laborious local
historian contemplated.&nbsp; The defects, and no doubt there
will be many discovered in it, are submitted to the kind and
impartial consideration of the reader.&nbsp; My humble position
in life will not in the slightest degree, I feel confident, tend
to <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>depreciate my long-cherished desire&mdash;especially as
the shades of evening are fast closing the day-light of my
earthly life&mdash;to add to the information which has already
been given respecting a parish to which I am much attached, both
by birth and early associations.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The earliest mention of Chelsea is to be found in the Saxon
Chronicle, in the year 785; from which record it appears that a
Synod was then held in it, and at which period it was the
residence of Offa, king of the Mercians.&nbsp; As regards the
etymology of its name both ancient and modern writers have
expressed different opinions.&nbsp; Mr. Lysons says, he has seen
it written Cealc-hylle, in an old charter of Edward the
Confessor, and hence objected to the obvious etymology, as there
is neither chalk nor hill in the parish.&nbsp; Mr. Faulkner
considers, however, that &ldquo;hylle&rdquo; is an evident
mistake for &ldquo;hythe;&rdquo; and Cealc-hythe signifies not a
place abounding in chalk, but a wharf or landing-place for chalk
brought from other quarters.&nbsp; This amended definition seems
at once to remove the previous objection, particularly as large
quantities of chalk and lime were formerly, and even now at
times, landed at a wharf by the river-side at Chelsea.&nbsp; In
the ancient record of Domesday, it is written Cherchede and
Chelched.&nbsp; The parish was called Chelchethe in the taxation
of Pope Nicholas, in 1291; and this was the common way of
spelling it for several centuries.&nbsp; Among the manorial
records of the time of Edward II. it is spelled Chelcheya and
Chelchuthe.&nbsp; Mr. Norden says, &ldquo;It is so called from
the nature of the place, whose strand is like the Chesel,
(ceosel, or cesel,) which the sea casteth up of sand and pebble
stones, thereof called Cheselsey, briefly Chelsey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How altered is the state of the strand or shore at the present
time!&nbsp; Would that there were now only the sand and pebble
stones!&nbsp; But there is a probability that this complaint will
be remedied.&nbsp; The long expected embankment from Battersea
Bridge to Chelsea College, it is said, really <i>is</i> to be
commenced and completed, and those old and dilapidated houses in
that narrow and dangerous thoroughfare, known as Duke Street and
Lombard Street, are to be pulled down.&nbsp; If this should be
the case, the parishioners will then possess one of the finest
promenades, with Battersea Park opposite to it, which may be
found along the entire banks of the river Thames.</p>
<p>Having made this slight digression, to infuse a little of what
is popularly called &ldquo;new life&rdquo; into our subject, we
will here mention that the county of Middlesex received its name
from <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>having
been inhabited by a party of Saxons, who, being located in the
midst of the three kingdoms of the East, West, and South Saxons,
were called by their neighbours Middlesaxons, which, in common
conversation, was soon abbreviated to Middlesex.</p>
<p>The parish of Chelsea is bounded on the north by the Fulham
Road, which separates it from Kensington.&nbsp; On the east at
the entrance into Sloane Square, at which place there was an open
rivulet, which divided it from St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover
Square, and was said to rise at or near to Hampstead; and, after
crossing Hyde Park, where it formed the Serpentine River, and
Knightsbridge, flowed behind Cadogan Place (along a portion of
Lowndes&rsquo; Square) into the Thames, at Ranelagh, which
adjoined Chelsea College.&nbsp; In January, 1809, this rivulet
overflowed its banks, and caused great devastation for several
days.&nbsp; The waters formed a complete lake, and were of
considerable depth.&nbsp; Boats were employed in carrying
passengers from Chelsea Hospital to the old Bunhouse, on their
way to London.&nbsp; On the west, the parish is divided from
Fulham a little beyond St. Mark&rsquo;s College; and on the south
it is bounded by the Thames.</p>
<p>That portion of the parish at Kensal New Town, which is near
to Wilsden, will be briefly noticed again in reference to the
&ldquo;Ancient Manor Houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; This land, as held by
the parish, is about 173&frac34; acres.</p>
<h3>The Old Parish Church.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will soon be seventy years since
I was first taken to this venerable Church.&nbsp; The most
trifling incidents in childhood often bring to remembrance, when
arrived at mature age, events of an important and interesting
character.&nbsp; Such was the case with regard to my earliest
conscious attendance at Chelsea Old Church.&nbsp; At the period
to which I allude, residing at the other part of the parish, we
had to go across what was then called the &ldquo;Common,&rdquo;
situated to the east of the present new St. Luke&rsquo;s Church,
a portion of which was at that particular time covered with
new-mown grass to dry previously to being carried away.&nbsp;
Most young persons love to toss and tumble about the hay when
such an opportunity is afforded them, and <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>certainly I
felt as delighted with the sport as others of my own age.&nbsp;
Often afterwards, when there was a disposition not to take me, I
earnestly pleaded to go with the rest to the Church, but my
youthful thoughts were more fixed on some anticipated enjoyment
on the road to it.&nbsp; As I advanced in years, however, my
native Old Parish Church became gradually endeared to me, and
nothing connected with it scarcely ever escaped my notice.</p>
<p>The exact period when the Church was erected is a question of
great uncertainty.&nbsp; In the Domesday Survey of the Parish no
mention is made of any endowment for a priest, which is
considered by some writers a proof that there was no Church
existing.&nbsp; This conclusion is doubtful.&nbsp; There is no
record relative to the Rectory previous to the reign of Edward
II., therefore it is conjectured that the Church was first
founded about that period.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowack says, &ldquo;In the year 1667, the old Church,
which was much decayed, being too small to contain the
congregation, grown large by the vast increase of buildings about
that time in the town,&rdquo; (what would he now think, in 1869,
of the immense number of houses, and 70,000 inhabitants!)
&ldquo;it was agreed by the parishioners that part of it should
be demolished, and that such alterations and additions should be
made as were necessary for decent accommodation.&nbsp;
Accordingly the shattered tower and west end of the Church were
pulled down, and the north and south aisles carried several yards
towards the west, by two brick walls, being in all about 80 ft.
from the ground.&nbsp; The walls of the Church were raised, the
windows enlarged, the old parts beautified, the inside new paved,
the churchyard considerably raised, and enclosed with a high wall
of brick; and most of this done at the voluntary charge of the
inhabitants, and the whole roof, lead, timber, &amp;c., at the
sole cost of the Lady Jane Cheyne.&nbsp; The Church was furnished
with all the necessary ornaments, and the steeple with a good
ring of six bells, by the bounty of the inhabitants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this statement it would appear that the Church was
originally of small dimensions.</p>
<h3>MONUMENTS, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>It will not be asserting too much if we say that the Old
Parish Church contains more magnificent monuments, to the
memories of distinguished individuals, than are to be found in
any other church in the metropolis.</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span><span
class="smcap">Lord Bray</span>.&mdash;In the chancel, the most
ancient monument is that of Lord Bray, and of his son Lord John
Bray.&nbsp; It is an altar-tomb, now much defaced, but was
originally ornamented with the effigies in brass of these two
noble lords, and with escutcheons of their arms.&nbsp; According
to Weever, there was the following inscription in his
time:&mdash;&ldquo;Of your charitie pray for the soul of Edmund
Bray, knight, Lord Bray, cosin and heire to Sir Reginald Bray,
Knight of the Garter.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is a very long and
curious account of the funeral of Lord John Bray in the
Herald&rsquo;s College, 1557.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span>.&mdash;Against the
south wall of the chancel is the monument of Sir Thomas More,
erected according to his own desire, in the year 1532.&nbsp; The
tablet on which the inscription is engraved is under a Tudor
arch, the cornice of which is ornamented with foliage, and in the
centre of it is his crest, viz., a Moor&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The
spandrils of the arch are ornamented with branches of the vine,
and in the midst are his arms and those of his first wife, and on
each side are the arms of himself and his two wives.&nbsp; The
eventful history of More, and the termination of his earthly
career, must be familiar to the reader.&nbsp; After he was
beheaded, his body is said by some to have been interred in the
church, but others have contended that it was buried in St.
Peter&rsquo;s, in the Tower.&nbsp; There are many legends
respecting the head, but Mr. Brayley asserts positively that it
was finally deposited in St. Dunstan&rsquo;s, near Canterbury,
and that he saw the head there many years ago.&nbsp; The
inscription on the tablet is of considerable length.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Marquise de Cugnac</span>.&mdash;Near
the Communion Table, against the south wall, on a square
ornamental slab, is an inscription to the memory of Elizabeth,
the wife of the Marquis de Cugnac.&nbsp; As a proof of his
unshaken love he erected this monument.&nbsp; She died in 1653,
aged 20 years.&nbsp; The marquis was of a Protestant family,
famous in the reigns of Henry IV., Lewis XIII. and XIV.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Sedile</span>.&mdash;In the south wall
of the chancel, near the altar, was usually placed the
&ldquo;<i>Sedile</i>&rdquo; a seat for the use of the priest at
certain intervals during the celebration of the Mass, but when
the church was almost rebuilt, in 1667, this ancient
architectural ornament, and many others were removed, and not a
vestige of them now remains.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span><span
class="smcap">Thomas Hungerford</span>, Esq.&mdash;In the upper
chancel is the monument of the above-named gentleman, having the
effigies of himself and his two sons in armour kneeling on one
side of an altar, and his wife and daughter on the other.&nbsp;
The entablature is supported by three Corinthian pillars, resting
on pedestals.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Rev. John Rush</span>.&mdash;On the right
of the one above are tablets to the memory of the Rev. John Rush
and family.&nbsp; He was Curate of the Parish for a great many
years, and when the new Parish Church was completed, Mr. Rush
became Minister of the Old Church, and resigned the curacy.&nbsp;
He was one of the Directors of the Waterloo Bridge Company, and
took a great interest in everything connected with the
construction of that bridge.&nbsp; He died in 1855, aged 85, and
was buried in the Brompton Cemetery.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Two Daughters of Wilton</span>, <span
class="smcap">the Sculptor</span>.&mdash;Against the east wall is
a monument, composed of two urns of white marble, to the memory
of Lucy Smith and Anne Wilton, two sisters, 1781.&nbsp; Wilton,
their father, was the sculptor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Original Altar Piece was very plain, formed by an obtuse
arch ornamented slightly with foliage, &amp;c.&nbsp; In the
centre was painted the Decalogue; while the north side displayed
the Camp of Israel, and the south side Moses on the Mount,
receiving the two tables of the Law.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Rev. <span class="smcap">Adam Littleton</span>, D.D.&mdash;On
a square marble tablet, against the north wall of the lower
chancel, is an inscription to the memory of this eminent divine,
who was rector of this parish for 24 years.&nbsp; He died in
1694, aged 66.</p>
<p>On the east wall, on plain marble slabs, are inscriptions to
the memory of Martha Denyer, who died in 1795, John Denyer, in
1806, and Elizabeth Denyer, in 1824.&nbsp; This family was very
benevolent.&nbsp; Amongst a few other inscriptions is one to the
memory of Edward Holl, Esq., who was a regular attendant at the
church, and much respected.&nbsp; He died in 1823.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Richard Gervoise</span>,
Esq.&mdash;Between the north aisle and lower chancel is a large
monument raised in the form of an arch open at both sides, about
10 ft. in height, ornamented with roses, branches, and fluted
carving, erected to the memory of Richard Gervoise, Sheriff of
London, who died in 1557, and also in memory of his son.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span><span
class="smcap">Baldwin Hamey</span>, M.D.&mdash;On a pillar, near
the preceding, are inscriptions to the memory of Dr. Baldwin
Hamey, Ralph Palmer, Esq., and Alice, his wife.&nbsp; Mr. Palmer
was a kind benefactor to the church.&nbsp; He died in 1715.</p>
<p>On the west side of the same pillar is an inscription to the
memory of Henry Powell, Esq., who was a great friend to the widow
and fatherless.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Colours of the Old
Volunteers</span>.&mdash;Over the nave are suspended the colours
of the two battalions of Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Royal
Volunteers, which were placed there on the disbandment of the
regiment.&nbsp; These banners were presented by her Majesty in
1804, at a time when the country was threatened with invasion. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; One or two of them are almost in
ribbons, but it is to be hoped they will remain untouched in
their present position as long as possible.&nbsp; There are still
living some few old people in the parish who remember, when boys,
marching by the side of these colours with all the heroic
consequence of supposed military triumph.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Pulpit</span> is composed of oak,
divided into panels, and ornamented with carved foliage and
fruit.&nbsp; There was formerly a massive sounding board to
correspond with it, but which was necessarily taken away when the
pulpit was judiciously placed in its present central position in
the middle aisle.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having noticed the chancel and nave, we will proceed to that
part which is called the <span class="smcap">Lawrence
Chapel</span>, at the north side.&nbsp; This chapel is considered
by many to be coeval with the first endowment of the
church.&nbsp; It was built by the then Lord of the Manor, whose
mansion stood near it, the site of which is now occupied by
Lawrence Street, so called after the Lawrence family.&nbsp; The
old manor house was pulled down by Henry VIII., who built another
in Cheyne Walk, to which allusion will have to be frequently
made.&nbsp; The Lawrence chapel was many years ago in the
possession of Mr. Offley, who bequeathed it to Colonel Needham,
of whom it was bought in the year 1789, with part of the east
side of Lawrence Street, to which it is an appendage, by Mr.
Lewer.&nbsp; It is still private property.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><span
class="smcap">Thomas Lawrence</span>, Esq.&mdash;Against the
north wall of this chapel is the monument of the father of Sir
John Lawrence, on which are represented himself, his three sons,
Elizabeth his wife, and six daughters, all kneeling.&nbsp; On the
cushion on which Mrs. Lawrence kneels are two babes, wrapped up
close to the chin, with their faces only visible.&nbsp; The
cornice is supported by three fluted Corinthian columns.&nbsp;
Underneath are the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The yeares wherein I lived were
fifty-fower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; October twenty-eight did end my life;<br />
Children five of eleven God left in store,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sole comfort of they&rsquo;re mother and my wife.<br
/>
The world can say what I have been before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am now examples still are rife;<br />
Thus Thomas Lawrence spekes to tymes ensving<br />
That Death is sure, and Tyme is past reneving.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir John Lawrence</span>, Bart.&mdash;On a
large ornamented tablet of black marble, against the east wall,
is an inscription to the memory of Sir John Lawrence, Bart., who
died in 1638, aged 50.&nbsp; Attached to it are these quaint
lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When bad men dye and turn to their last
sleep,<br />
What stir the poets and engravers keep,<br />
By a feigned skill to pile them up a name,<br />
With terms of Good, and Just, out-lasting fame:<br />
Alas! poor men, such most have need of stone<br />
And epitaphs; the good, indeed, lack none,<br />
Their own true works enough do give of glory<br />
Unto their names, which will survive all story:<br />
Such was the man lies here, who doth partake<br />
Of verse and stone&mdash;but &rsquo;tis for fashions
sake.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the same wall is the monument of Sarah Colvile, daughter of
Thomas Lawrence, Esq., and wife of Richard Colvile, of Newton, in
the Isle of Ely.&nbsp; From small trusses, ornamented with human
heads, rise two Doric pillars, with a curved entablature which
supports a pediment.&nbsp; The soffit of the cornice is decorated
with clouds, stars, and a dove; and on the edge of the cornice is
a passage of Scripture (1 Cor. xv. 52).&nbsp; Between the pillars
is a half-length figure of a female, wrapped in a winding sheet,
with her hands in a supplicating posture, and as rising from the
tomb.&nbsp; The inscription states she was the happy mother of
eight sons and two daughters.&nbsp; She died in 1631, in the 40th
year of her age.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is also an inscription on the floor of this chapel to
the memory of Henry, youngest son of Sir John Lawrence, who died
in 1661, aged 30.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span><span
class="smcap">Lady Jane Cheyne</span>.&mdash;This stately
monument is placed against the wall of the north aisle, but
before we proceed to give a description of it, we will notice the
inscription that was placed at the entrance to the vault of the
Cheyne family, at the bottom of the chancel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Charles Cheyne, Esq., Lord of this Manor of
Chelsea, which was purchased by the rich dowry of his wife,
erected this burial-place for his most excellent wife, the Lady
Jane Cheyne, eldest daughter of William Duke of Newcastle, not
long deceased, and for his own use, when he shall die.&nbsp; It
was consecrated the 3rd day of November, 1669.&nbsp; I beseech
thee, Almighty God, that she may quiety rest here till the
resurrection of the flesh.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The monument consists of a semi-circular temple, the
fa&ccedil;ade supported by two Corinthian columns of Scagliola
marble, rising from a plinth and pedestals, with a proper
entablature, surmounted by an elliptical pediment, the tympanum
of which is ornamented with scroll work and foliage, and the
soffit of the upper cornice consists of panels, with rosettes and
foliage, and dentals, with pendant gutt&aelig; placed
alternately.&nbsp; To give the latter a resemblance of their
original intention, the base of the pediment was justly decreased
in width in the centre.&nbsp; From acrotini at the shoulders rise
flaming urns, and in the centre is a richly ornamented
cross.&nbsp; In the interior of this temple is a large black
sarcophagus, resting on pedestals of Scagliola marble.&nbsp; On
this sarcophagus is represented Lady Cheyne, in white marble,
lying upon her left side, and reclining upon a tesselated
cushion, holding a book; at her feet lies a coronet.&nbsp; This
monument was executed by the celebrated Bernini, and cost
&pound;500.&nbsp; It is generally considered to be a <i>chef
d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i> of art.&nbsp; Lady Cheyne died in 1669,
aged 48.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the sarcophagus, under the figure of Lady Jane Cheyne, is
an inscription to the memory of Charles Cheyne, Viscount
Newhaven, and Lord of the Manor of Chelsea, who was buried in the
same vault.&nbsp; He departed this life in 1698, aged 74, being
29 years after Lady Jane Cheyne, his first wife&rsquo;s
death.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Richard Guildford</span>, Esq.&mdash;On a
marble tablet, near the preceding, is this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;Richard Guildford, who died 16th Nov.
1680, and also his two wives, Abigail and Elizabeth.&nbsp; He
gave to this parish for ever a yearly sum of &pound;10, to be
distributed on the 5th of December, the day of his wedding with
his wife Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span><span
class="smcap">Henry Raper</span>, Esq.&mdash;Near this spot are
deposited the remains of this gentleman, who died in 1789, and of
his wife Katherine Raper, who died in 1823.&nbsp; This family was
greatly respected.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the west end of the north aisle formerly stood the old
font, and in a book case close to it a large folio Bible,
Fox&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs, a folio Common Prayer Book, and the
Homilies of the Church of England, each secured with a
chain.&nbsp; The books are now placed at the south side of the
church, and the present marble font stands at the entrance to the
middle aisle.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the left of the great western entrance is an inscription on
a marble tablet to the memory of Mrs. Bayley, who died in 1828,
aged 45.&nbsp; This tablet was placed by her uncle, Wilton, the
sculptor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Ashburnham Bell</span>.&mdash;This
bell originally in the steeple that was taken down for security
in 1815, is now placed in the porch, as a relic of former
days.&nbsp; On a board near the bell are recorded the following
particulars:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This bell was given to the Old Parish
Church of Chelsea by the Hon. Wm. Ashburnham in the year
1679.&nbsp; It was a grateful offering on his part to commemorate
his escape from drowning in the Thames, into which he had
wandered during a dark night of the above year, and from which he
was saved by hearing the clock of this church strike the hour of
nine.&nbsp; Many changes in the church having taken place since
then, and this bell having long remained unused and nearly
forgotten, it is here preserved as an interesting Chelsea
antiquity, having been removed from the Clock Tower and placed in
its present position by order of the Church Trustees, and under
the direction of</p>
<p>A. <span class="smcap">Gerald W. Blunt</span>, M.A.,
Rector.</p>
<p>R. <span class="smcap">Henry Davies</span>, B.A., Incumbent of
the Church.</p>
<p>T. B. <span class="smcap">Diplock</span>, M.D., G. W. <span
class="smcap">Richards</span>, } Churchwardens.</p>
<p><i>March</i> 1862.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was another account given of this bell many years
ago.&nbsp; It was that the Hon. W Ashburnham was returning home
from Lambeth in a boat at night, when almost suddenly there came
a dense fog over the river, which prevented him seeing any object
whatever.&nbsp; He became alarmed, and allowed the boat to drift
for some distance, expecting every moment it would run <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>foul of some
barge or craft, and that he would be plunged into the river, when
to his great joy he heard Chelsea Church clock strike nine, and,
judging from the sound that he was nearly opposite the church, he
seized the oars and pulled away as direct as he could towards it,
and at length landed safely on shore.&nbsp; It afterwards
appeared that had the boat drifted much further it would have
been upset, and in all probability Mr. Ashburnham would have met
with a watery grave.&nbsp; The family, considering the striking
of the clock to have been a most providential means of saving his
life, gave the bell, and made certain conditions that it should
be rung every evening during the winter months, in case of any
future similar event.&nbsp; The sexton paid 5s. to the
bell-ringer for attending at nine o&rsquo;clock, as stated, for
the season.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the right of the western entrance, in the south aisle, is
an inscription to the memory of Teak S. Edwards, Esq., F.L.S.,
who died in 1819, aged 50.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a faithful delineator
of nature few equalled, and none excelled.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near to where now the Homilies are placed was originally fixed
the monument of Lt.-Col. the Hon. H. Cadogan, executed by
Chantrey, a fine specimen of that celebrated sculptor&rsquo;s
chisel.&nbsp; It was removed to the New Parish Church, some years
since, and consequently it must be noticed in the account of that
beautiful architectural edifice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Lord and Lady Dacre</span>.&mdash;This is
one of the most magnificent monuments that can be found in any
parish church in London, and my only surprise is that so few of
the inhabitants of the parish, comparatively, have inspected
it.&nbsp; It stands against the wall of the south aisle, and was
erected to the memory of Gregory, Lord Dacre, and Anne, his
wife.&nbsp; They are represented in white marble, lying on a
sarcophagus, under an arch supported by marble pillars of the
Corinthian order.&nbsp; Lord Dacre is in armour, with a long
beard and short hair; her ladyship is habited in a gown and long
cloak with a ruff.&nbsp; A dog is at the feet of each.&nbsp; On
either side is a lofty obelisk.&nbsp; Over the arch are the arms
of the family; the whole is richly ornamented with flowers and
several pieces of elaborate Mosaic work.</p>
<p>The parish of Chelsea, by Lady Dacre&rsquo;s will, have some
presentations to her Almshouses in Westminster, on condition of
keeping the monument in repair.&nbsp; It has been lately painted
and beautified.&nbsp; Lord Dacre died in 1594, and Lady Dacre in
1595.&nbsp; This monument was originally placed in Sir T.
More&rsquo;s <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>chapel, it is so described in Lady Dacre&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; When the church was almost rebuilt in 1667, it was
placed in its present situation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On a marble tablet, against the same wall, is an inscription
to the memory of Catherine, wife of the Rev. T. Mahon, Rector of
Newport, Co. of Mayo, Ireland, who died in 1822, aged 20.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Arthur Gorges</span>.&mdash;Bowack, in
his &ldquo;Antiquities of Middlesex,&rdquo; mentions a monument
raised about 4 ft. from the ground, with the effigies of Sir
Arthur Gorges, his lady, three sons, and five daughters, in brass
plates fixed thereon, no trace of it can now be discovered.&nbsp;
There is, however, on a black slab, fixed against the north wall
of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s chapel, an inscription to the memory
of Arthur Gorges, Esq. (eldest son of Sir Arthur Gorges), who
died in 1668.&nbsp; He married Mary, daughter of Lord
Bayning.&nbsp; This was her third marriage.&nbsp; She is here
buried with her husband.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s Chapel</span>,
which was built by him, belonged to the proprietor of his house
until it was sold by Arthur Gorges, Esq., to Lionel, Earl of
Middlesex, when he reserved the chapel to himself, as he
continued to reside at Chelsea in another house.&nbsp; In 1664,
when he sold the last-mentioned house, he only renewed a right of
burial for his family.&nbsp; The chapel passed therefore with the
house, through various owners, to Sir William Milman, and
ultimately it became the freehold property, for many years, of
the late Mr. Mann, of Paradise Row, now called Queen&rsquo;s Road
West.&nbsp; It is still private property.&nbsp; A large Gothic
arch opens into the chancel, and is supported by pillars, the
capitals of which are ornamented with human heads, rudely but
curiously carved, together with bundles of rods resembling the
fasces or badges of the ancient Roman magistrates; on the
entablature of the easternmost is the date 1527.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Duchess of
Northumberland</span>.&mdash;The venerable monument of Lady Jane
Guildford, Duchess of Northumberland, is placed against the north
wall of this chapel.&nbsp; This interesting memorial consists of
an altar-tomb under an arched recess, crowned by four canopies
and supported by five reticulated pillars, the bases of which
rest on the altar-tomb as on a plinth.&nbsp; The faces of the
tomb are divided into panels, containing quatrefoils enclosing
shields, and one coat of arms remains.&nbsp; The back of the
recess is divided into three compartments by small graduated <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>buttresses;
that on the west contained the arms, and sons, while that on the
east displays the effigies of the Duchess and her
daughters.&nbsp; The soffit of this recess is richly groined, the
canopies are divided by graduated buttresses with pinnacles at
their apices; they consist of a trefoiled arch with angular
pediments crocketed, and terminating in rich finials, and the
spandrils are panelled.&nbsp; The frieze, formed by two
cavittoes, is ornamented, the lower with rosettes, and the upper
with portcullis and rosettes arranged alternately.&nbsp; The
whole is surmounted by a cornice of foliage.&nbsp; The Duchess
appears in the front, kneeling, habited in a surcoat, with her
arms richly emblazoned, originally in enamel.&nbsp; Behind her
are her daughters, with their Christian names engraved over their
heads in Gothic letters.&nbsp; On the left side were represented,
on a brass plate, (now long torn off) the effigies of her
sons.&nbsp; The inscription states that the Duchess had issue
thirteen children, eight sons and five daughters.&nbsp; She died
&ldquo;at her maner of Chelsey, ye 22 daye of January, in ye
second yere of ye reigne of our Sovereyne Lady Queene Mary the
first, and in <span class="GutSmall">A.D</span> MDLV., on whose
soul Jesus have mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir W. Milman</span>.&mdash;On the same
wall as the preceding is the monument of this gentleman, who died
in 1713.&nbsp; There is also another to the memory of several of
the same family.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Robert Stanley</span>.&mdash;The
monument of this distinguished resident is at the east end of the
chapel.&nbsp; Two figures, representing Justice and Fortitude,
support the arms of Stanley, and three large urns; on the centre
one, on a medallion, is the bust of Sir Robert in alto relievo,
who is represented with whiskers but no beard.&nbsp; On the urns,
on each side, are medallions of two of his children, whose deaths
are noticed on the monument.&nbsp; He died in 1632, and was the
second son of the &ldquo;Earle of Darbie.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near the principal window here is a small brass plate fixed
into a marble tablet to the memory of Humphrey Peshall, Esq., who
died in 1650.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There are a few other inscriptions in different parts of the
church, but the principal and most ancient ones have been all
noticed.&nbsp; We will now proceed, therefore, to describe some
of the monuments in the old churchyard.</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span><span
class="smcap">Dr. Chamberlayne</span>.&mdash;On the south side,
fronting the river, there are several monuments to the memory of
this family, for the erection of which and for making a vault Dr.
Chamberlayne obtained a grant from the parish, in consideration
of a benefaction which will probably be mentioned
hereafter.&nbsp; He was buried here in 1703.&nbsp; On the left
side of the western window, on a large mural slab, is an
inscription to his memory.&nbsp; The latter part of it is
remarkable:&mdash;&ldquo;He was so studious of doing good to all
men, and especially to posterity, that he ordered some of his
books, covered with wax, to be buried with him, which may be of
use in times to come.&nbsp; God preserve thee, O traveller! go,
and imitate him.&nbsp; This monument, not to be rashly violated,
his friend, Walter Harris, Doctor of Physic, caused to be erected
as a testimony both of his respect and grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Harris evinced some singularity of opinion,&rdquo;
says Mr. Faulkner, &ldquo;in supposing that posterity would gain
any information from works thus entombed with the body of their
author; but whatever might have been the intention, his views in
depositing the books in the tomb of his friend have been
frustrated, as, some years since, Dr. Chamberlayne&rsquo;s tomb
yielded to the injuries of time, and, on examination, it was
discovered that the damp and moisture admitted by the general
decay, had totally obliterated almost every appearance of them;
his seal, with his arms, was however still perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A <span class="smcap">Female Heroine</span>.&mdash;One of the
inscriptions to the memory of the Chamberlayne family is as
follows:&mdash;In a vault hard by lieth Anne, sole daughter of
Edward Chamberlayne, LL.D., who long declining wedlock, and
aspiring above her sex and age, fought under her brother, with
arms and manly attire, in a fire-ship, against the French, for
six hours, on the 30th June, 1690.&nbsp; After returning home she
married Sir John Spragg, with whom she lived very affectionately
for eighteen months, but, giving birth to a child, she died a few
days after in 1691!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the north side of the churchyard, on a mural monument, is
an inscription to the memory of John Pennant, Esq., who died in
1709.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Hans Sloane</span>, Bart.&mdash;In the
south-east corner is a large and handsome monument to the memory
of this distinguished resident in the parish, and of his
lady.&nbsp; As frequent notices are taken of Sir Robert Stanley
in this work, it is only necessary here to give a brief
description of the tomb.&nbsp; It is composed of Portland stone,
on the top of which, under a portico, supported <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>by four
pillars, is placed a vase of white marble, with four serpents
entwined around it, executed out of one piece; on each side is an
entablature, the arms on one, and the crest on the other.&nbsp;
It was executed by Wilton, the statuary, and was caused to be
erected there by his two daughters, Elizabeth Cadogan and Sarah
Stanley.&nbsp; Sir Hans Sloane died in 1753, in his 92nd
year.&nbsp; Lady Sloane died in 1724.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Henry S. Woodfall</span>, Esq.&mdash;Near
the north-east corner of the churchyard, on a flat stone, was
some years since an inscription to the memory of Henry S.
Woodfall, the celebrated printer of the Letters of Junius, who
spent the latter part of his life in calm retirement amongst his
Chelsea friends.&nbsp; He was an associate of many distinguished
literary characters, and died in 1805.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Philip Miller</span>, Esq.&mdash;Close to
the preceding spot is an obelisk to the memory of Philip Miller,
Curator of the Botanic Gardens, Chelsea, and Author of the
Gardeners&rsquo; Dictionary, &amp;c.&nbsp; He died in 1771, aged
80.&nbsp; This monument was erected by the Fellows of the
Linn&aelig;an and Horticultural Societies in 1815.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Against the wall of the old Vestry Room (now School Room) are
tablets to the memory of Thomas Bowes, M.D., F.R.S., William
Moncrieff, Professor of Humanity at St. Andrew&rsquo;s, and Mrs.
Methuen.&nbsp; The dates of these are 1723 and 1732.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>These are the principal raised cenataphs and mural tablets in
this ancient churchyard.</p>
<h3>ERECTION OF AN ORGAN.</h3>
<p>On the 22nd of January, 1818, the following resolution was
unanimously carried at a meeting in Vestry
assembled:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved that this meeting sensibly feels
the propriety as well as the necessity of an organ being placed
in the parochial Church, and that the best means to effect this
desirable object will be by voluntary subscription, and that it
be immediately entered into.&rdquo;&nbsp; A committee was
appointed to carry this <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>resolution into effect, and Luke
Thomas Flood, Esq., was requested to become the treasurer, but,
although a great many contributions were received, the aggregate
sum was insufficient for the purpose, and the money was tendered
back to the subscribers.&nbsp; This failure, and the offer made,
occasioned considerable amusement amongst some of the
parishioners, and many laughable squibs were printed and
circulated.&nbsp; The most ludicrous of these was a poetic
effusion, written by a gentleman of education and who was not
altogether a stranger in literary circles.&nbsp; It was entitled
&ldquo;<i>The Organ in the Suds</i>,&rdquo; and embodied much of
that wit and humour which is so frequently displayed in
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Punch</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometime
afterwards, however, the effort was successfully renewed, and an
organ was purchased.&nbsp; The two principal candidates for
organist were Mr. Goss, then comparatively unknown in the musical
world, but who has since risen to eminence as a composer, and is
now organist at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and Mr. Ling, who had
become a great favourite with many of the subscribers.&nbsp; The
feeling amongst the friends of these gentlemen was very strongly
manifested, and the proceedings on the day of election were
characterized by much excitement.&nbsp; Mr. Ling obtained the
greatest number of votes from the subscribers, and consequently
was elected.&nbsp; Mr. Goss, however, was appointed organist of
the New Church, when it was completed, by the Church Trustees,
agreeably to the decision of Dr. Crotch, Mr. Attwood, and some
others, who were requested to decide on the relative
qualifications of the candidates.&nbsp; There were a great many
parishioners present on this occasion.</p>
<p>From the Report of the Old Church Organ Committee, dated Feb.
16, 1819, a copy of which is now before me, it appears that the
entire amount received was &pound;325 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; that
the organ cost &pound;200, and that the expenses altogether were
no less than 125 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, including &pound;24
4<i>s.</i> for a Faculty, and &pound;25 to Mr. H. Bevington, for
removing the organ and keeping it in repair for twelve months, as
per agreement.&nbsp; The remaining expenditure was for necessary
alterations in the gallery, and for fittings, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
organ had been previously erected in a private mansion, which
will explain the charge for removal, and the sum paid for the
organ was considered at that time to be a great bargain.</p>
<p>The singing, prior to the erection of the organ, was indeed
very bad, being almost entirely confined to the school children,
who were placed in galleries specially erected for them, at the
extreme western part of the church, and so close to the ceiling
that a grown person could scarcely stand upright in them.</p>
<h3><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>SPRING
TIDES.&mdash;TAKEN TO CHURCH IN A BOAT.</h3>
<p>A circumstance occurred at the church, about the year 1809, of
a singular character.&nbsp; There had been some very high tides
during the week, and on the following Sunday morning the waters
rose several feet against the southern boundary wall, which
rendered the employment of a boat necessary to convey those of
the congregation who resided in the neighbourhood near to
Battersea Bridge to the western entrance of the church.&nbsp;
Although there have been some very high spring tides since that
time, I am happy to say, the congregation have always been
enabled to walk to the Old Church without the least fear of being
drowned on their way to it!&nbsp; The raising of the road, and
other alterations, have no doubt checked such overflowings at
this particular spot.</p>
<h3>DOING PENANCE.</h3>
<p>The next event is one of unusual interest.&nbsp; The statement
may be relied upon as authentic, and the circumstance of its not
having gained publicity has been owing to the few persons who
witnessed it and the secrecy enjoined, but after nearly sixty
years have elapsed, and the individuals concerned being long
since deceased, the particulars may now be fairly disclosed
without any breach of confidence.</p>
<p>A short time after the conclusion of Divine Service, on a
Sunday morning, a gentleman alighted from a carriage and
proceeded to the Vestry Room, where two others were waiting his
arrival.&nbsp; As soon as the congregation had dispersed, the
parties, with two or three parochial officers, &amp;c., went to
the entrance of the middle aisle, and the inner door being
closed, the person especially referred to hurriedly knelt
down.&nbsp; A paper was then placed in his hand, which was a
recantation of certain opprobrious epithets that he had applied
to a lady in one of the streets in the parish, stigmatizing her
publicly by a term which the reader can easily supply.&nbsp; When
he recited the offensive words he laid particular emphasis on
them, evidently in a spirit of bravado and not of
contrition.&nbsp; Penance and penitence were not in any way,
apparently, considered by him <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>as synonymous terms.&nbsp; There is
scarcely an individual who would suppose that such an event
occurred, at so comparatively recent a period as sixty years ago,
in the old Parish Church of St. Luke, Chelsea.</p>
<h3>SACRILEGE.</h3>
<p>On Wednesday night, the 27th of December, 1827, this church
was sacrilegiously broken into, and the following articles
stolen, viz., two plated flagons, two plated chalices, two plated
salvers, a blue cloth covering the Communion Table, and a table
cloth and napkin for the same; a crimson cushion and hanging for
the pulpit, the brass branches from the pulpit and those from the
chandeliers in the middle aisle.&nbsp; On Thursday night, the 1st
of February following, the church was again entered and robbed of
the chandeliers, the brass curtain rods, and the cushions from
the churchwardens&rsquo; and overseers&rsquo; pews.</p>
<p>A reward of &pound;100 was offered by the Secretary of State,
and &pound;70 by the parish, for the discovery of the robbers,
who were soon after taken, tried at Newgate, and condemned to be
transported for life.</p>
<h3>RECTORS AT THE OLD CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The following is a list of the names of most of the rectors,
commencing with the earliest one recorded, and terminating with
the Hon. and Rev. G. V. Wellesley, D.D., who continued of course
rector when the new St. Luke&rsquo;s Church was completed.&nbsp;
The list of subsequent rectors will be found placed in the notice
of that church:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Rev. Dr. Littleton was educated at Westminster School,
under the celebrated Dr. Busby, and afterwards became Prebendary
of Westminster.&nbsp; He was well skilled in the Oriental
languages and in rabinnical learning.&nbsp; He died at Chelsea in
1694, in the 67th year of his age.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Dr. John King was a divine of considerable literary
eminence.&nbsp; Amongst a variety of works he published a sermon,
entitled, &ldquo;The Divine Favour the best Alliance; or,
Repentance the Safest Sanctuary in Times of Danger; preached at
the Parish Church of Chelsey,&rdquo; in 1701.&nbsp; There is in
the British Museum a small quarto volume, in manuscript, by Dr.
King, containing &ldquo;Remarks on the Life of Sir Thomas
More,&rdquo; and a letter, designed for Mr. Hearne, respecting
Sir T. More&rsquo;s house at Chelsea.&nbsp; He died in this
parish in 1732, aged 80, much respected, and was buried at
Pertenhall.&nbsp; The family of Dr. King bear the same arms with
Robert King, the first Bishop of Oxford.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Sloane Elsmere died in 1776, and left behind him
a volume of sermons to be published for the benefit of the
&ldquo;Girls&rsquo; Charity School,&rdquo; of which he was the
original founder.&nbsp; He was a relation of Sir Hans Sloane.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
Rev. Reginald Heber received his school education at the Free
School, Manchester, from whence he removed to Brasenose College,
Oxford.&nbsp; Mr. Heber, in 1766, succeeded to a considerable
estate (his elder brother dying unmarried) at Hodnet, in
Shropshire; and in the same year he was inducted to the rectory
of Chelsea, the presentation to which had several years before
been purchased for him by his brother.&nbsp; He found the
rectoral house in bad condition, and partly rebuilt and greatly
improved the whole of it.&nbsp; In 1770 he exchanged the rectory
of Chelsea with Dr. Drake, rector of Amersham, Bucks, for Malpas,
in Cheshire.&nbsp; Mr. Heber married, in 1773, the daughter of
the Rev. Martin Bayly, which lady died the following year,
leaving an infant son, Richard Heber, who became Member for the
University of Oxford.&nbsp; Eight years after he married,
secondly, the daughter of Dr. Cuthbert Allanson, by whom he had
two sons, Reginald, the late lamented Bishop of Calcutta&mdash;a
prelate whose memory is revered by Christians of all
denominations&mdash;the other son was Thomas Cuthbert Heber, and
he had also one daughter.&nbsp; Mr. Heber died at Malpas in 1804,
in his 76th year.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hon. and Rev. William Bromley Cadogan, second son of Lord
Cadogan, was born in 1751, and had his education at Westminster
School, from whence he was removed to Christ Church College,
Oxford.&nbsp; He obtained several prizes at the University for
classical knowledge.&nbsp; On the death of Dr. Drake he was
presented to the rectory of Chelsea.&nbsp; He also became vicar
of St. Giles&rsquo;s, Reading.&nbsp; Mr. Faulkner gives a
singular anecdote relating to the unsolicited offer of this
vicarage to Mr. Cadogan.&nbsp; Lord Bathurst, who was then
Chancellor, called at Lord Cadogan&rsquo;s house, and desired to
see him.&nbsp; His lordship was not at home; and the servants,
seeing Lord Bathurst very plainly dressed, admitted him into the
hall only, having no suspicion of his high rank.&nbsp; The
Chancellor therefore wrote a note at the hall table, requesting
Lord Cadogan to accept the vicarage of St. Giles&rsquo;s,
Reading, for his son.&nbsp; The offer of so valuable a
preferment, and so near to the family seat at Caversham, was
peculiarly acceptable to Lord Cadogan.&nbsp; It appeared,
however, that the parishioners were deeply affected by the death
of the Rev. Mr. Talbot, their late vicar, and equally grieved at
the appointment of his successor; but they flattered themselves
that the new vicar, being a young gentleman of noble family,
would feel no disposition to do the duties himself, and that the
Rev. Mr. Halward, who had been recently appointed, and towards
whom they already were much attached, might be <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>continued in
the curacy.&nbsp; A petition for this purpose was presented to
Mr. Cadogan, but it was rejected with strong marks of
disapprobation.&nbsp; The old congregation therefore became
dispersed.&nbsp; Some of them, under the patronage of the
Countess of Huntingdon, opened a place for Divine worship for
themselves, while others, who were unwilling to leave the church
altogether, thought that they perceived marks of sincerity in his
conduct and preaching, attempted, by frequent admonitory letters,
to convince Mr. Cadogan of what they considered to be his
&ldquo;errors,&rdquo; and to set him &ldquo;right.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On this occasion several letters passed between him and Mrs.
Talbot, the widow of the previous vicar, whose house was opened
for religious exercises, and where prayer was occasionally
offered up for his conversion.&nbsp; Mr. Cadogan is said to have
been highly offended, but at length, humbled and subdued, he fell
at the feet of accumulated kindness, and confessed to the last
moment of his life, that &ldquo;Mrs. Talbot&rsquo;s letters and
example were the principal means of leading him to the saving
knowledge of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; It produced, it appears, a
great change in his manner of preaching, and led the way to his
intimacy with the Rev. Mr. Hill, Mr. Romaine, and others, who
were distinguished by the title of popular preachers.&nbsp; He
likewise offered the curacy to Mr. Halward, who previously he had
but &ldquo;lightly esteemed,&rdquo; but that gentleman had then
accepted some preferment which prevented him from acceding to the
offer.&nbsp; Mr. Cadogan divided his time between Chelsea and
Reading; but finding his labours in both places too arduous, he
let the rectory-house, and left Chelsea in charge of the Rev. Mr.
Middleton, his curate, except at the season of Lent, and of the
Sacrament, on which occasions the church was crowded.&nbsp; Mr.
Cadogan was seized at Reading on a Thursday evening, after his
lecture, with an inflammation of the bowels, and departed this
life on the following Tuesday, expressing with his lips that
which was his &ldquo;glorious theme, the unbounded love of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 1797, aged 46.</p>
<p>A monument, designed by Bacon, is erected in the church at
Reading.&nbsp; Beneath the inscription are the crosier or
pastoral staff; the rod of Aaron, which budded and yielded
almonds; and the book mentioned in the Revelations, as sealed
with seven seals.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Charles Sturges was presented to this rectory in
1797.&nbsp; Respectful mention is made of him in Mrs.
Trimmer&rsquo;s publication on the Sunday Schools of Old
Brentford.&nbsp; He has a copy of Latin verses in the Mus&aelig;
Etonenses, and another in the Academi&aelig; Cantabrigiensis
Luctus, on the death of George II.&nbsp; <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The sudden
death of Mr. Sturges was another verification of that passage in
our Burial Service, &ldquo;In the midst of life we are in
death,&rdquo; &amp;c., which he had read many times at the graves
of the parishioners.&nbsp; He expired on the 22nd of April, 1805,
after only half an hour&rsquo;s illness, from an apoplectic
seizure, immediately before the hour of dinner, at the rectory of
Loddington, Northamptonshire, and his remains were interred in
the chancel of that church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hon. and Rev. Gerald Valerian Wellesley, D.D., succeeded
Mr. Sturgess.&nbsp; A notice of him will be found in the account
of the New Parish Church.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. R. H. Davies, M.A., who had been previously senior
curate of the new Parish Church, succeeded the Rev. John Rush
when he died in 1855, as Incumbent of the Old Church.&nbsp;
Through his exertions and instrumentality, a small vestry, or
robing room, has been attached to the church.&nbsp; The great
inconvenience and injury to the Minister&rsquo;s health, arising
from his having to walk across the churchyard in his robes, and
also to change them, especially in the winter months, had been
sadly experienced and justly complained of by almost every
officiating clergyman in my recollection.&nbsp; Very considerable
alterations and great improvements have likewise been made in the
interior of the church, during the fourteen years that Mr. Davies
has been the Incumbent, without interfering greatly with its
ancient architecture.&nbsp; Perhaps the best way to convey an
adequate idea of what has been accomplished will be to give an
account of the expenses, taken from a Report recently
published.</p>

<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>A great
part of the cost of these extensive and essential alterations was
contributed by the Trustees for building the new St. Luke&rsquo;s
Church; a very large portion by the liberal contributions of the
congregation, and a part also by the Rev. Mr. Davies&rsquo;s own
friends not connected with the church, and others to whom he
applied.&nbsp; The schools, as will be seen, have been greatly
benefitted, and various charitable societies established, by
which means vast blessings have been conferred on the poor in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>PETYT&rsquo;S SCHOOL ROOM AND VESTRY.</h3>
<p>In the year 1706, a Vestry Room and School Room, with
apartments for a master, were erected at the expense of W. Petyt,
Esq. <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; There is a descriptive
inscription upon the west front of the school room, which records
the donation, at the conclusion of which it is added, &ldquo;To
all which may God give a blessing.&nbsp; Soli Deo
Gloria.&rdquo;&nbsp; The original deed of gift is entered in the
Vestry minutes.&nbsp; Mr. Petyt resided in Church (lane) Street,
and died there in 1707, aged 71, but was buried in the Temple
Church.&nbsp; He was a member of the Inner Temple, and Keeper of
the Records in the Tower of London.</p>
<p>In 1819 there were 100 boys and girls educated and clothed
free of any expense to their parents.&nbsp; The girls at that
period were instructed in a house rented in Lordship&rsquo;s
Place, near Cheyne Row.&nbsp; These schools, with the master and
mistress, were transferred to the new School Rooms, at the back
of the present Parish Church.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Davies recently appealed to the Vestry for a
grant of &pound;100 to make considerable repairs in this old
building, it being in a most dilapidated condition (the ground
floor, which was the Vestry Room, was for some time previously
used as a fire-engine station), and the one school room
altogether inadequate for the proper accommodation of the
children of the district, promising himself to be answerable for
the deficiency in the amount of the expenditure.&nbsp; The
Vestry, in consideration <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of its having been bequeathed to the
parish, complied with the request.&nbsp; Mr. Davies likewise
obtained for the same laudable object a grant of &pound;20 from
the Ragged School Union, the congregation generously contributing
the remaining sum required to put the building in thorough
repair.&nbsp; The entire cost was rather more than
&pound;279.&nbsp; There are now three good school-rooms instead
of one, as was formerly the case, and consequently the number of
children attending the schools has been greatly augmented.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It may here be mentioned that the &ldquo;watchhouse,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;stocks&rdquo; for vagrants, formerly stood close
to the river, opposite the church.</p>
<h3>History of the Manor.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ROYAL AND DISTINGUISHED
RESIDENTS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Blackstone</span>, in his
&ldquo;Commentaries,&rdquo; says that manors are, in substance,
as ancient as the Saxon Constitution.&nbsp; The manor of
Chilchell, or Chelcheya (Chelsea), was given it appears, in the
reign of Edward the Confessor to the Abbot and Convent of
Westminster, by Thurstan, the governor of the king&rsquo;s
palace, who held it of him.&nbsp; This gift was confirmed by a
charter, which transfers the manor, with all its rights and
appurtenances, as fully as it was held by Thurstan:
&ldquo;besides, together with this manor, as a free gift, every
third tree, and every third horse load of fruits grown in the
neighbouring wood at Kyngesbyrig&rdquo; (now called
Knightsbridge).&nbsp; This charter, which is in the Saxon
language, is still preserved in the British Museum.&nbsp; It is
sealed with a waxen seal, suspended by a silken string, after the
Norman fashion, in the front of which are the effigies of the
king, holding in his right hand a cross, and in his left a globe;
on the reverse is the same image, holding in his right hand a
spear surmounted by a dove, and bearing in his left a sword, with
this inscription on both sides, &ldquo;The seal of Edward King of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King William, by a charter dated at Westminster, confirmed the
land to the Monastery of Westminster.</p>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>The
Record of Domesday Book, to which we are so greatly indebted, was
begun in 1080, and completed in 1086.&nbsp; In it is mentioned
the lands in Chelsea, then in possession of the Church of
Westminster.</p>
<p>The general description given of menial persons, including
those in the manor of Chelsea, at the period when the survey of
the land belonging to the lords, or great landowners, was taken,
shows the lamentable state of thousands of our
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Slaves were allowed nothing but
subsistence and clothes, and were distinguished from freemen by a
peculiar dress.&nbsp; Long hair was a mark of dignity and
freedom; for that reason, slaves, (menial persons,) were obliged
to shave their heads, by which they were reminded of their
inferiority of condition.&nbsp; At length Henry VIII. granted
manumission to two of his slaves and their families, for which he
assigned this just reason: &ldquo;God at first created all men
equally free by nature, but many had been reduced to slavery by
the laws of men.&nbsp; We believe it, therefore, to be a pious
act, and meritorious in the sight of God, to set certain of our
slaves at liberty from their bondage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The granting
of leases, which afterwards followed, almost completely
emancipated the &ldquo;villain-slave,&rdquo; so that at the time
of Elizabeth, scarcely any person existed to whom the former laws
applied.</p>
<p>Gervace, abbot of Westminster, aliened the manor of
Chelchithe, to his mother Dameta and her heirs.&nbsp; Afterwards
it was held by the heirs of Bartholomew de Fontibus.</p>
<p>Several court rolls of this manor, during the reigns of King
Edward III. and Richard II. are among the records of the Dean and
Chapter of Westminster.</p>
<p>A brewer, of the name of North, was presented at one of these
courts for not putting up a sign as was customary; and at another
the wife of Philip Rose was fined 6<i>d.</i> for being a common
babbler.</p>
<p>Simon Bayle appears to have been lessee of the manor house, 33
Hen. VI., and from that period there is a total deficiency of
records till the reign of Henry VII.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Reginald Bray was now in possession of the manor.&nbsp; He
was Receiver General to Sir Henry Stafford, a younger son of the
Duke of Buckingham, who married the widow of the Earl of
Richmond, and mother of Henry VII.&nbsp; There are many
interesting historical particulars respecting Sir Reginald
Bray.&nbsp; He was buried in the chapel of St. George,
Windsor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From Sir Reginald Bray the manor descended to Margaret, only
child of his next brother, John, who married Sir William <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Sandys,
created afterwards Lord Sands.&nbsp; He was one of those peers
who subscribed the articles exhibited to Henry VIII. against
Cardinal Wolsey; and the next year was also one who signed the
declaration to the Pope, intimating the danger of losing his
supremacy, in case he did not comply with the king&rsquo;s wishes
in regard to his divorce from Queen Catherine.&nbsp; He died in
1542.</p>
<p>There have been various surmises as to the correct definition
of &ldquo;Sands End,&rdquo; in Fulham parish, which immediately
adjoins Chelsea, and is called such for a short distance.&nbsp; I
venture to suggest the following explanation.&nbsp; Lord Sands,
being Lord of the Manor of Chelsea, his rights terminated at the
spot just mentioned, and to record this fact the people of Fulham
called it Sands End, signifying thereby that Lord Sands&rsquo;s
jurisdiction and property ended there.&nbsp; Perhaps this idea is
not original, but I have never heard it thus explained, and
therefore I have given it.</p>
<p>This Lord Sands, a few years previous to his death, conveyed
to Henry VIII. the manor of Chelsea, with certain closes or land
situated at Kensal Green, near Wilsden, containing about
137&frac34; acres. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; In 1861 there were in that part
of Kensal which belongs to this parish 591 houses and 3223
inhabitants.&nbsp; The number of houses has since increased, and
the present population may be estimated at 3500 persons.&nbsp;
There are a great many highly respectable residents, and a large
number of superior new houses are continually being erected in
the adjoining wealthy parishes, which will ultimately increase
the trade and value of property in the entire district.&nbsp;
There are also several new Churches and Chapels built within the
last few years in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Paddington Canal,
which passes through the detached parts of Chelsea and
Kensington, was opened with an aquatic procession on the 10th of
July, 1801, in the presence of a vast concourse of
spectators.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Henry VIII. was probably induced to possess this
manor,&rdquo; says Mr. Faulkner, &ldquo;from having observed, in
his frequent visits to Sir Thomas More, the pleasantness of the
situation on the banks of the Thames; and from the salubrity of
the air, deeming it a fit residence for his infant daughter, the
Princess Elizabeth, then between three and four years of
age.&nbsp; But, on his obtaining it, finding that the manor house
was ancient, and <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>at that time in possession of the Lawrence family, <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> he erected a new manor house on the
eastern side of Winchester House,&rdquo; which stood on the site
of the river-side entrance to Oakley Street, Cheyne Walk.&nbsp;
It was &ldquo;here the young Princess was nurtured, and it most
probably was her chief residence during her father&rsquo;s
reign.&nbsp; In 1540, Sir Francis Bryan was made &lsquo;Keeper of
Chelsey&rsquo; for life, by patent, 31 Hen. VIII.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the marriage of Henry with Catharine Parr, this manor was
assigned to that Queen as part of her jointure.&nbsp; Most
unfortunately for her future welfare, Catharine, after the
decease of the king, placed her affections upon the brother of
Jane Seymour, Thomas Lord Seymour, to whom she was subsequently
married.&nbsp; Whatever she might have dreaded from the temper of
her previous royal husband, was realized in the accumulated
injuries she received from Seymour, whose turbulent passions and
uncontrolled ambition led him to aspire to the hand of the
Princess Elizabeth, who then resided at Chelsea under the
Queen&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; She died at Sudeley Castle in 1548, not
without suspicion of poison.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the death of Catharine Parr, the manor was bestowed on
the Duke of Northumberland by Edward VI.&nbsp; On the accession
of Mary, the duke was impeached, attainted of high treason, and
beheaded in 1553.</p>
<p>Jane, Duchess of Northumberland, was a most singular instance
of the vicissitudes of fortune, having been the wife of one of
the greatest men of that age, she lived to see her husband lose
his head on a scaffold; to see one son share his father&rsquo;s
fate, another die in a prison, and the rest of her children live
only by permission.&nbsp; Amidst this accumulated distress, which
was heightened by the confiscation of her property, she displayed
great firmness of mind, though left destitute of fortune and
friends, till the arrival of some of the Spanish nobility, who
interested themselves so warmly in her favour, that they
prevailed on the Queen to reinstate her in some of her former
possessions.&nbsp; She made a will, written with her own hand,
unassisted by the advice of any learned in the laws.&nbsp;
Amongst a variety of other bequests, she left to Sir Henry Sidney
the gold and green hangings in the manor house, &ldquo;water
side, at <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>Chelsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My will,&rdquo; she says,
&ldquo;is earnestly and effectually, that little solemnities be
made for me, for I had even have a thousand foldes my debts to be
paide, and the poore to be given unto, than anye pompe to be
shewed upon my wretched carkes; therefore to the wormes will I
goe, as I have afore wrytten in all poyntes, as you will answer
yt afore God; and you breke any one jot of it, your wills
hereafter may chaunce be as well broken.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the strict injunctions contained in her will, she
was buried with great funeral pomp, in February, 1535; two
heralds attending, with many mourners, six dozen of torches, and
two white branches, and &ldquo;a canopy borne over her effigies
in wax, in a goodly hearse to the church of Chelsey.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Ann of Cleves, after her divorce from Henry VIII., appears to
have resided in this manor house, where, it is said, she died in
1557, and was buried in Westminster.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Queen Elizabeth, in 1559, leased this manor to Ann, Duchess of
Somerset, widow of the late Protector, for life.&nbsp; Her
Majesty afterwards granted the manor to John Stanhope, Esq.,
vice-chamberlain of her household.&nbsp; On the accession of
James I. he was created Lord Stanhope, of Harrington.</p>
<p>After several families had held the manor, we find it in
possession of the Cheyne family.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles Cheyne, afterwards Viscount Newhaven, married Lady
Jane, eldest daughter and co-heir of William Duke of Newcastle,
with whom he obtained an immense fortune.&nbsp; This lady is
celebrated for her excellent endowments, which she exhibited in a
distinguished manner during the civil wars in the reign of
Charles I., in her keeping the garrisoned house of her father,
where she was left with one of her sisters, against the enemy,
till, overpowered by their force, she was made prisoner, but, by
the success of the royal arms, it was retaken.&nbsp; Her duty and
piety to her exiled father, in making repeated remittances, which
she effected by the sale of some rich jewels left her by her
grandmother, the Lady Ogle, after the vain efforts she had made
for his pardon, deserve to be remembered.&nbsp; Lord Cheyne, as
we learn from the inscription on Lady Jane&rsquo;s monument,
purchased the manor of Chelsea with a part of the large dower she
brought him on his marriage.&nbsp; His lordship very highly
embellished the house and gardens, and they excited some
curiosity at the time.&nbsp; Mr. Evelyn, in his Diary, thus
notices <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>them: &ldquo;I made my Lord Cheyney a visit at Chelsea,
and saw those ingenious water-works invented by Mr. Winstanley,
in which were some things very surprising and
extraordinary.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Mr. Winstanley was the ingenious
architect who built the Eddystone Lighthouse, and perished in it
when blown down by the great storm in 1703.&nbsp; When Lord
Cheyne died in 1698, he was succeeded by William, his son and
successor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Hans Sloane, Bart., purchased the manor of William Lord
Cheyne, the second and last Viscount Newhaven, in the year
1712.&nbsp; Sir Hans was descended from a family originally of
Scotland, but settled in the north of Ireland, where he received
his first education.&nbsp; At that early age he evinced a very
strong inclination to study the works of Nature, which he pursued
with uncommon application through the rest of his life.&nbsp;
Being desirous of improving himself in the several branches of
physic, to the profession of which he was ardently devoted, he
came to London, and resided in a house adjoining to the
laboratory of Apothecaries&rsquo; Hall.&nbsp; Here Mr. Sloane
acquired a perfect knowledge of the preparations and uses of most
chemical medicines; and at the same time prosecuted his favourite
science of botany in the Apothecaries&rsquo; Gardens at
Chelsea.&nbsp; He ultimately became President of the Royal
College of Physicians, London, and associated and corresponded
with most of the eminent men of his day.&nbsp; He had been
previously Secretary to the Royal Society, which he held for 20
years without any salary, and was the intimate friend of Sir
Isaac Newton.&nbsp; In the last sickness of Queen Anne he was
called in to her assistance, as one of her physicians, as he had
been on some former occasions.&nbsp; He was created a baronet by
George I., an honour which had never before been conferred upon
any physician in England.&nbsp; Upon purchasing the manor of
Chelsea, he gave a portion of the ground of his garden to the
Apothecaries&rsquo; Company, in order to perpetuate it for the
improvement of botanical knowledge, and to communicate to others
that instruction which he had himself received there.&nbsp;
Besides the donation of so large and valuable a piece of ground,
in a delightful situation on the banks of the Thames, and near
the metropolis, he contributed largely towards building the
stairs at the water-side gate, and an additional sum towards the
expenses of the garden.&nbsp; When Sir Isaac Newton died, Sir
Hans Sloane was chosen as President of the Royal Society, and
continued in that high office for fourteen successive
years.&nbsp; His decay was very gradual, and foretold that he
would one day &ldquo;drop like a fruit fully ripe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He died in 1753, and was interred in the <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>churchyard of
Chelsea, in the same vault with his lady.&nbsp; His funeral was
attended by many persons of distinction, and several Fellows of
the Royal Society.&nbsp; He has been styled &ldquo;the father of
natural history in these realms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Hans Sloane&rsquo;s invaluable Museum, sold to the nation
at his decease for &pound;20,000, being about a fourth of its
value, was the nucleus, and so far the first foundation, of the
British Museum.&nbsp; He bequeathed one moiety of the manor of
Chelsea to his daughter Sarah, the wife of George Stanley, Esq.,
of Paultons, in Hampshire, and the remainder to his second
daughter, the lady of Charles Lord Cadogan, in which family the
property still remains.&nbsp; Hence the names of Cheyne Walk,
Hans Place, Sloane Street, Cadogan Place, Oakley Street, and
Paultons Square.&nbsp; The eldest son of Earl Cadogan takes his
father&rsquo;s second title, Viscount Chelsea.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stanley, daughter of Sir Hans Sloane, left one son and
two daughters; Hans Stanley, Esq., the son, who died in 1780, and
bequeathed to his sisters, Anne, the wife of W. Ellis, Esq.,
afterwards Lord Mendip, and Sarah, the wife of Christopher
D&rsquo;Oyley, Esq., his moiety of this manor, with the reversion
to Lord Cadogan and his heirs.</p>
<h3>Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s House.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span> purchased an estate
at Chelsea, about the year 1520, and built himself a house, as
Erasmus describes it, &ldquo;neither mean nor subject to envy,
yet magnificent and commodious enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; The site of
this house has been long disputed.&nbsp; The Rev. Dr. King, (who
is noticed amongst the rectors of the Old Church), in his
&ldquo;Letter designed for Mr. Hearne,&rdquo; relative to Sir
Thomas More&rsquo;s house, and which is in the British Museum,
says, &ldquo;As seven cities in Greece contended for the
birthplace of Homer, so there are no fewer than four houses in
this parish which lay claim to Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s residence,
viz.: that which is now the Duke of Beaufort&rsquo;s; that which
was lately Sir Joseph Alstone&rsquo;s; that which was once Sir
Reginald Bray&rsquo;s, and afterwards William Powell&rsquo;s,
which is now built into several tenements; and that which was
lately Sir John Danvers&rsquo;s, which is also now pulled down;
and on <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>part of the ground a small street is built, called
Danvers Street, and some other houses.&nbsp; Now of all these, in
my opinion, Beaufort House bids fairest to be the place where Sir
Thomas More&rsquo;s stood.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then proceeds to give
his reasons for arriving at this conclusion, which, when
considered in connection with the statements of other writers on
the subject, clearly establishes the correctness of Dr.
King&rsquo;s opinion.&nbsp; Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s house,
therefore, we will conclude stood almost on the site of what is
now called Beaufort Street, facing Battersea Bridge.&nbsp; After
his death, however, very considerable alterations and additions
were made by succeeding occupants, both in regard to the house
and grounds attached to it.&nbsp; The house, in its altered
state, was pulled down about 140 years ago.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Erasmus gives a pleasing description of the manner of
More&rsquo;s living with his wife and family at Chelsea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There he conversed with his wife,&rdquo; says he,
&ldquo;his son, his daughter-in-law, his three daughters and
their husbands, with eleven grand-children.&nbsp; There is not a
man living so affectionate to his children as he; he loveth his
old wife as well as if she was a young maid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fox, in
his Martyrology, however, throws a sad blast over the character
of More.&nbsp; He states that More used to bind heretics to a
tree in his garden, called &ldquo;The Tree of Troth,&rdquo; but
this was denied by More himself.&nbsp; Henry VIII., to whom he
owed his rise and fall, frequently came to Chelsea to visit
him.&nbsp; Sometimes the king would ascend to the house-top with
him to observe the stars and converse on astronomy.&nbsp; Amongst
the illustrious foreigners entertained and patronised by Sir
Thomas More, may be mentioned Hans Holbein, a celebrated painter,
who lived with him for nearly three years painting portraits of
him, his relations, and friends.&nbsp; It is generally admitted
that he had a house in Chelsea for aged people, whom he daily
relieved.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>More delighted in telling the following &ldquo;merrie
story,&rdquo; as he termed it:&mdash;A friar while preaching
&ldquo;spyed a poore wyfe of the paryshe whysperyng to her
pew-fellow, and he fallyng angry thereto, cryde out unto her
aloude, &lsquo;Hold thy babble, I byd thee, thou wyfe in the red
hood!&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He regularly attended Chelsea Church,
and very often assisted at the celebration of Mass, and at times
he would put on a surplice and join the quire.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The pathetic story of More&rsquo;s wit was never so touchingly
illustrated as on the day after he resigned the Great Seal.&nbsp;
He went to Chelsea Church as usual with his wife and family, none
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of whom he
had yet informed of his resignation.&nbsp; During the service, as
was his custom, he sat in the choir, in a surplice.&nbsp; After
service it was the custom for one of his attendants to go to her
ladyship&rsquo;s pew, and say, &ldquo;My Lord is gone
before.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this day the Ex-Chancellor came himself,
and making a low bow, said, &ldquo;Madam, my Lord is
gone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, on their way home, to her great
mortification, he unriddled his mournful pleasantry by telling
her his lordship was gone, in the loss of his official
dignities.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Thomas had four children, three daughters and one son; the
latter was the youngest.&nbsp; His first wife wished very much
for a boy; at last she brought this son, who proved to be of
slender capacity; upon which he said to her, &ldquo;You have
prayed so long for a boy, that now you have got one that will be
a boy as long as he lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; The good lady walked away
from him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By indefatigable application, More cleared the Court of
Chancery of all its causes.&nbsp; One day, having ended a cause,
he called for the next, and was told there was &ldquo;no other
depending in the Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was delighted to hear it,
and ordered it to be inserted on the records of the Court.&nbsp;
It gave rise to the following epigram, not the worst in the
English language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When More some time had Chancellor been<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; No More suits did remain;<br />
The same shall never More be seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till More be there again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pitiful story of More&rsquo;s daughter, Margaret, parting
with her beloved father, on the morning of his cruel execution,
is truly affecting.&nbsp; She followed him to the
scaffold&mdash;embraced him, implored his blessing, wept upon his
cheek, bidding him in anguish adieu.&nbsp; A second time she went
forward to him, clung round his neck and kissed him, when at
last, notwithstanding his apparent gravity, tears fell from his
eyes * * * and soon afterwards she was severed from him for
ever!&nbsp; It appears that his original intention to be interred
in the Old Church, was unhappily not fulfilled.&nbsp; Dr. King
states that &ldquo;his body was buried in the chapel of St.
Peter, in the Tower, and his head, after some months, was bought
by his daughter, Margaret, and taken down from London Bridge,
where it was fixed upon a pole, and was buried,&rdquo; probably
as stated, in St. Dunstan&rsquo;s, near Canterbury.&nbsp; Aubery,
however, asserts that &ldquo;after he was beheaded, his trunke
was interred in Chelsey Church, near the <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>middle of the
south wall, where was some slight monument erected, which being
worne by time, Sir John Lawrence, of Chelsey, at his own proper
costs and chardges, built to his memorie a handsome one, with
inscription, of marble.&rdquo;&nbsp; This statement, as regards
the interment of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s body, does not accord
with the opinion of most other writers on the subject.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the death of More, his mansion was granted in the 28th
of Henry VIII. to Sir William Paulet, afterwards Marquis of
Winchester, to whom Edward VI. granted in fee both that and all
other premises in Chelsea and Kensington, forfeited by his
attainder.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Marquis of Winchester, who was so much of a courtier as to
accommodate himself to princes as well as to subjects of very
different characters, was, from his natural and acquired
abilities, perfectly qualified to act with propriety in the
highest offices of the state.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward VI. he
was made Lord High Treasurer of England.&nbsp; It is said that by
his councils, in a great measure, the Duke of
Northumberland&rsquo;s design of setting the Lady Jane Grey on
the throne was prevented; for which good office of loyalty to
them, the Queens, Mary and Elizabeth, continued him in the
Treasurer&rsquo;s Office, which he enjoyed for thirty years; and
on being asked how he preserved himself in that place through so
many changes of government, he answered, &ldquo;By being a
willow, and not an oak.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died in 1572, aged 97
years.&nbsp; The marquis greatly enlarged and improved the house,
and, according to Norden, &ldquo;adorned Chelsea with stately
buildings.&rdquo;&nbsp; His eldest son, John, second Marquis of
Winchester, died at Chelsea in 1576.&nbsp; The widow of the first
marquis died in 1586.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Gregory, Lord Dacre, soon afterwards had possession of Sir
Thomas More&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He was the son of Thomas Fynes
Lord Dacre, who succeeded his grandfather in the 26th of Henry
VIII.; and who, in 1541, was engaged with some other persons in
chasing the deer in Sir Nicholas Pelham&rsquo;s park, when a fray
arising between them and the keepers, in which one of the latter
was killed, he was found guilty of being accessary to the murder,
and suffered death accordingly; but his children were restored to
their honours in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Gregory,
Lord Dacre, died at Chelsea in 1594, without issue; and his
sister Margaret, the wife of Samuel Lennard, Esq., claimed the
barony, and was allowed it in the second of James I.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Lady
Dacre survived her husband but a few months, and bequeathed her
house at Chelsea, with all its appurtenances, to the great Lord
Burleigh, with remainder to his son Robert, afterwards Earl of
Salisbury, and Lord High Treasurer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
seen,&rdquo; says Lysons, &ldquo;among the records at the Rolls
Chapel, a pardon of alienation to Sir Robert Cecil, dated June
21, 39th Elizabeth, for acquiring these premises of Thomas Lord
Buckhurst.&rdquo;&nbsp; This distinguished nobleman, afterwards
Earl of Dorset, was brother to Lady Dacre, and resided frequently
with his sister at Chelsea, but it is not known whether he had
any interest in the estate.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Earl of Salisbury is supposed to have rebuilt Sir Thomas
More&rsquo;s house, as the initials of his name were to be seen
on the pipes and in several of the rooms.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, bought the house of the Earl
of Salisbury, and probably came immediately to reside in it, as
there are some entries respecting his family in the Parish
Register in the beginning of the year 1609.&nbsp; By his first
wife, Lady C. Hastings, daughter of Francis, Earl of Huntingdon,
he had two sons, Thomas, his successor in the title, and Edward;
and by his second wife, widow of W. Norris, Esq., he had a
daughter, Elizabeth, who married Sir Arthur Gorges, and also two
sons, Henry and Robert.&nbsp; The latter died in 1609, and was
buried at Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Arthur Gorges, on the death of Henry, Earl of Lincoln,
became the possessor of the house, and he and Lady Elizabeth, his
wife, in consideration of &pound;4300, sold it to Sir Lionel
Cranfield, afterwards created Earl of Middlesex.&nbsp; It was
described as the &ldquo;greatest house at Chelsea, with two fore
great courts adjoining, environed with brick walls, also a wharf
(landing-place for a pleasure boat, &amp;c.) lying in front,
having a high brick tower on the east and west ends, and a high
water tower, standing upon the west corner of the wharf, and the
watercourse belonging thereto.&nbsp; An orchard, a garden, having
a peryment standing up in the middle, and a terrace on the north
end thereof, with a banquetting house at the east end of the
terrace, having a marble table in it.&nbsp; A great garden,
dovecote close, containing five acres, the kitchen garden,
brick-barne close, containing ten acres.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord
Middlesex held the mansion till 1625, when he sold it to Charles
I., who, in 1627, granted the said house, &amp;c., to the Duke of
Buckingham.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>George
Villiers, first Duke of Buckingham, the son of Sir George
Villiers, was born in 1592.&nbsp; By the elegance of his person,
and the courtliness of his address, he gained as great an
ascendance over King James as the favourite of any other prince
is known to have done by a long course of assiduity and
insinuation.&nbsp; The Earl of Clarendon says, that the duke
&ldquo;was of a most flowing courtesy and affability to all men
who made any address to him, and so desirous to oblige them, that
he did not enough consider the value of the obligation, or the
merit of the person he chose to oblige; from which much of his
misfortune resulted.&rdquo;&nbsp; He married Lady Catherine
Manners, the daughter of Francis, Earl of Rutland, by whom he had
three sons and a daughter; he was assassinated at Portsmouth in
1628, by one Felton.&nbsp; The eldest son, George, who succeeded
him in his title and estates, being very young at the time of his
father&rsquo;s murder, was sent to travel during the civil wars;
and returning to England whilst Charles I. was under restraint,
he and his brother, Lord Francis Villiers, thought themselves
obliged to venture their lives and fortunes for the king at the
first opportunity.&nbsp; Soon after, the Parliament voted that he
should be proceeded against as a traitor, and that his estates
should be sequestered.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s house, for such it ought still to be
considered, notwithstanding the great alterations made in it, was
now known as Buckingham House, in consequence of its having been
granted to the first Duke of Buckingham.&nbsp; It appears by the
following extract from a periodical paper after that duke&rsquo;s
death, to have been in possession of his daughter Mary, who
married James, Duke of Richmond and Lenox: &ldquo;The Duchess of
Lenox, daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, being then at Oxford,
petitioned the Lords for leave to come to London, or to her house
at Chelsey, to be under Dr. Mayerne&rsquo;s hands for her health;
a pass was ordered for her, and the concurrence of the Commons
desired.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Buckingham House, in 1649, having been seized by the
Parliament, was committed to the custody of John Lisle, one of
the Commissioners of the Great Seal.&nbsp; This gentleman&rsquo;s
own estates were afterwards confiscated, and he then retired to
the continent.&nbsp; He was shot by some unknown person as he was
going to church at Lausanne.&nbsp; A short time after the house
was granted to Sir Bulstrode Whitlock, who resided with his
family at Chelsea for some years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Sir
Bulstrode Whitlock was the son of a Judge of the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench; he wrote a memorial of English affairs from
the latter part of the reign of Charles I. to the
Restoration.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George, the second Duke of Buckingham, soon after the
Restoration, recovered his father&rsquo;s estates, and was the
possessor of this house for a few years, but was soon obliged to
dispose of it for the benefit of his creditors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dryden, in his poem of Absalom and Achitophel, has drawn the
following portrait of this nobleman in the character of
Zimri:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A man so various, that he seemed to be<br
/>
Not one, but all mankind&rsquo;s epitome:<br />
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,<br />
He&rsquo;s every thing by starts, and nothing long;<br />
But in the course of one revolving moon,<br />
Was Chymist, Fidler, Statesman, and Buffoon.<br />
In squandering wealth, was his peculiar art,<br />
Nothing went unrewarded but desert.<br />
Beggar&rsquo;d by fools, when still he found, too late<br />
He had his jest, and they had his estate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>James Plummer, one of the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s principal
creditors, was the person in whose name this house was aliened in
1674, in trust, for George, Earl of Bristol, who is said to have
died at Chelsea, and to have been buried in the church, but there
is no memorial of him, or entry of his interment in the Parish
Register.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George Digby, Earl of Bristol, was born in 1612, and was
educated at Oxford; he soon became distinguished by his
remarkable advancement in all kinds of elegant literature.&nbsp;
In the beginning of the Long Parliament he was disaffected to the
Court; shortly afterwards he appeared a declared enemy to the
Parliament; and having testified his dislike of their proceedings
against Lord Strafford, he was expelled the House of Commons in
1641.&nbsp; Upon the death of the king his lordship was exempted
from pardon by the Parliament, and obliged to live in exile till
the restoration of Charles II., when he recovered all he had
lost; he grew very active in public affairs, spoke frequently in
Parliament, and made himself conspicuous for his enmity to Lord
Clarendon.&nbsp; Lord Bristol died in 1677, &ldquo;neither loved
nor regretted by any party.&rdquo;&nbsp; The house at Chelsea he
bequeathed to his Countess, Lady Ann Russell, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>daughter of
Francis, Earl of Bedford, who sold it in 1682, to the Marquis of
Worcester, created Duke of Beaufort, and who died in 1699.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The name of the house was now changed to Beaufort House.&nbsp;
Mr. Evelyn, in his Diary, makes frequent mention of
it:&mdash;&ldquo;I went with my Lady Sunderland to Chelsey
(1679), and dined with the Countess of Bristol (her mother) in
the great house, formerly the Duke of Buckingham&rsquo;s, a
spacious and excellent place for the extent of ground and
situation, in a good air.&nbsp; The house is large, but
ill-contrived, though my Lord of Bristol expended much money upon
it.&nbsp; There were divers pictures of Titian and Vandyke, and
some of Bassans, very excellent, especially an Adonis and Venus,
a Duke of Venice, a Butcher in his shambles selling meat to a
Swiss, and of Van Dyck, my Lord of Bristol&rsquo;s picture, with
the Earl of Bedford&rsquo;s at length.&nbsp; There was in the
garden a rare collection of orange trees, of which she was
pleased to bestow some upon me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, in 1683, Mr.
Evelyn says, &ldquo;I went to see what had been done by the Duke
of Beaufort on his house at Chelsey; he had made great
alterations, but might have made a better house with the
materials and the cost he had been at.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry, second Duke of Beaufort, by his will, dated in 1712,
left all his estates, in trust, to be sold, and the produce
appropriated according to a settlement made at his
marriage.&nbsp; The house, however, continued to be the residence
of that noble family till about the year 1720.&nbsp; Mary, relict
of the first duke, died here in 1714, at the good old age of 85
years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It may here be observed that Chelsea, not only in former
times, but at the present period, 1869, is admitted to be
generally a very healthy parish.&nbsp; This assertion is proved
by the weekly reports given to the Vestry by Dr. Barclay, the
medical officer of health, and which is confirmed by other
gentlemen of the medical profession.&nbsp; The reports read at
the meetings of the Chelsea Board of Guardians, also, shew that a
great many of the inmates of the workhouse live to a very
advanced age; and from peculiar facilities I possessed, many
years ago, I can positively assert that the number of aged
persons, who had for a long period been residents, was greater
than in most of the other suburban parishes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Hans Sloane, after the mansion had stood empty for several
years, purchased it in 1736, for the sum of &pound;2,500 at a <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>public sale,
and had it pulled down in 1740.&nbsp; The gate, which was built
by Inigo Jones for the Lord Treasurer Middlesex, he gave to the
Earl of Burlington, who removed it to his gardens at Chiswick,
which occasioned the following lines by <span
class="smcap">Pope</span>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">PASSENGER.</span></p>
<p>O Gate, how com&rsquo;st thou here?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">GATE.</span></p>
<p>I was brought from Chelsea last year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Batter&rsquo;d with wind and weather;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inigo Jones put me together;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sir Hans Sloane,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me alone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burlington brought me hither.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This gate was placed in an avenue near the house at Chiswick,
and consisted of a portico, supported by two columns of the Doric
order on one side, and pilasters on the other.&nbsp; On two stone
tablets were inscribed: &ldquo;Builded by Inigo Jones, at
Chelsea, <span class="GutSmall">MDCXXI</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Given by Sir Hans Sloane, baronet, to the Earl of
Burlington, <span class="GutSmall">MDCCXXXVII</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Bowack thus describes Beaufort House in 1705: &ldquo;This
house is between two and three hundred feet in length, has a
stately ancient front towards the Thames, also two spacious court
yards, and behind it are very fine gardens.&nbsp; It is so
pleasantly situated, that the late Queen Mary had a great desire
to purchase it before King William built Kensington, but was
prevented by some secret obstacles.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Attached to the house was a chapel, which appears to have been
attended by a few of the inhabitants.&nbsp; In various marriage
licenses, granted in 1722, and in other years, persons were to be
married in the Parish Church, in the chapel of Chelsea College,
or the chapel of Beaufort House.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above account of this celebrated mansion cannot fail to be
highly interesting to the generality of readers.&nbsp; Mr.
Faulkner has truly observed, &ldquo;that few houses can boast of
having been the residence of such a succession of noble and
distinguished characters.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Beaufort (row) Street, which was begun to be built about
1766, takes its name from the Duke of Beaufort.&nbsp; A portion
of his vast estate was the property of Mr. Long, a very old and
respected parishioner, partly leasehold, under Earl Cadogan, and
some of it, if not all, is still held by that family.</p>
<h3>Battersea Bridge, Sailing Matches, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>To meet the tastes of all classes of readers, I shall
occasionally deviate from the prescribed order which it was my
original intention to have pursued; by doing so it will remove
the weariness that frequently arises, especially in works of this
description, from dwelling too long on one particular
subject.&nbsp; This motive, I trust, will be accepted as an
apology for apparent digressions.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was formerly a Ferry a little eastward of the spot where
now stands Battersea Bridge, and consequently not far distant
from the distinguished mansion just described.&nbsp; It belonged
to Thomas, Earl of Lincoln, who sold it in 1618 to William
Blake.&nbsp; After some time it became the property of Sir Walter
St. John, and passed with the Bolingbroke estate to Earl Spencer,
under whom it was held in 1766, when an Act of Parliament was
obtained for building a bridge over the Thames, from Chelsea to
Battersea, and empowering Lord Spencer to build the same.&nbsp;
Fifteen proprietors having subscribed a sum of money each, it was
accordingly begun in 1771, was opened for foot-passengers in the
same year, and in the following year was ready for
carriages.&nbsp; From 1772, when the bridge was finally erected,
to the present time, 1869, is exactly 97 years, and this is the
precise age of it.&nbsp; It is a most unsightly structure of
wood, about one furlong in length, 28 ft. wide, and its cost
rather more than &pound;20,000.&nbsp; The proprietors have a vote
for the counties of Middlesex and Surrey.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lamps were first placed on the bridge in 1799, and in 1821 and
1822 an iron railing 4-ft. high, on the western side, was
substituted for the original wooden railing, and in 1824, the
eastern <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>side was completed.&nbsp; So far apart were the original
wooden railings, which were placed crossways, that the body of a
child might have passed through them, and, if not observed, no
person cognizant of the fatal accident.&nbsp; There were also, at
the above period, eight projecting recesses, four on each side,
constructed for the safety of foot-passengers, and a slightly
raised pathway made.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The number of lives that have been sacrificed at this bridge,
together with the barges sunken at it, even within the last few
years, is really painful to contemplate.&nbsp; It is a sad
contrast, in every respect, to the elegant structures that now
span the river, and it is to be hoped there will soon be erected
another one in its place&mdash;one that will be an ornament to
Chelsea, Battersea, and the metropolis.</p>
<h3>HYDE PARK ON THE THAMES.</h3>
<p>That part of the river, known as Chelsea Reach, was so
fashionable a rendezvous of pleasure boats and barges in the
reign of Charles II. that some persons have described the scene
as being a sort of Pall Mall Afloat, and it was called
&ldquo;Hyde Park on the Thames,&rdquo; in that king&rsquo;s
reign.&nbsp; The reach is the widest of any part westward of
London Bridge, which rendered it peculiarly suitable for such
grand aquatic displays.&nbsp; There were dukes and duchesses,
marquises, earls, and barons, with a similar fashionable throng
to that which may still be witnessed in Hyde Park.&nbsp; The
watermen were arrayed in dresses of all colours, and the whole
presented a scene of grandeur which cannot be adequately
described.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Fishing, at the above period, was carried on to a very
considerable extent at Chelsea; but, owing to the fishermen using
unlawful nets, and other causes, it fell into decay, and,
finally, proved an unprofitable speculation.&nbsp; In my earlier
days two or three fishermen earned a scanty living by selling the
fish they caught, and a few lovers of angling also occasionally
&ldquo;pulled up&rdquo; some very fine roach and dace, in the
prime season, at Battersea Bridge.</p>

<p>The river at Chelsea, some years since, presented in the
summer season a very animating and pleasing scene.&nbsp; The
sailing matches attracted numbers from London, and excited great
interest amongst the inhabitants.&nbsp; As aged men, however, are
said to see nothing now equal to &ldquo;the days when they were
young,&rdquo;&mdash;and lest it should be thought I was
magnifying the scene, making the sailing matches of former days
something like, for excitement and enthusiasm, the present
renowned Oxford and Cambridge Boat Races&mdash;I will endeavour
to avoid the possibility of being charged with giving an
exaggerated description of them.&nbsp; But, seriously speaking,
it may be said, with truth, that Cheyne Walk and Battersea
Bridge, on such occasions, were crowded with many of the
nobility, and a vast number of ladies and gentlemen, either in
carriages or on horseback.&nbsp; The fleet of sailing boats, with
the little <i>Spitfire</i> generally ahead, and &ldquo;Tom
Bettsworth,&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a> the owner, on board, when seen at a
short distance approaching Chelsea, with the sun shining on the
white canvas sails, and other pleasure boats decorated with
flags, in many of which were musicians playing various lively
popular tunes, presented a sort of miniature resemblance to those
delightful spectacles which are now only to be seen off Erith,
&amp;c.&nbsp; The steamboats have rendered such displays
impracticable for some years past at Chelsea, and pleasures of
this kind must give way to the transactions of business and
public convenience.&nbsp; Commodore Capt. Harrison, a
distinguished member of one of the first Yacht Clubs, took a
great interest in the Chelsea Sailing Matches.&nbsp; He resided
in the parish, and was highly esteemed for his conviviality and
gentlemanly deportment.&nbsp; His remains were interred in the
Brompton Cemetery.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I will now renew the notices of distinguished residents in
this part of the parish, occasionally giving a short description
of new public erections, and other interesting particulars.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Henry
Sampson Woodfall, Esq., was born in Little Britain, in 1739, and
when he retired from the active affairs of life, he took a house
in Lombard Street, near the Old Church.&nbsp; At a very early age
he had the honour of receiving from Mr. Pope half-a-crown for
reading to him, with much fluency, a page of Homer.&nbsp; When
twelve years old he was sent to St. Paul&rsquo;s School, on
leaving which he was apprenticed to his father, a printer in
Paternoster Row; and at the age of nineteen he had committed to
his charge the whole business of editing and printing the
&ldquo;Public Advertiser.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this period till the
beginning of 1793, he continued constantly in the exercise of
this laborious function.&nbsp; During so long a time, when
parties ran extremely high in politics, it is not surprising that
a printer should have gotten into some difficulties.&nbsp; He
used jocularly to say to his Chelsea friends that he had been
fined and confined by the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench; fined by
the House of Lords and Commons, and indicted at the Old
Bailey.&nbsp; He laid particular emphasis on the words
&ldquo;fined&rdquo; and &ldquo;confined.&rdquo;&nbsp; His conduct
respecting those celebrated letters, signed <span
class="smcap">Junius</span>, displayed great integrity and
disinterestedness of character.&nbsp; He associated much with
Garrick, Coleman, Bonnel, Thornton, Smollett, Goldsmith, and
other wits of his day, and his own conversation overflowed with
interesting anecdotes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this street resided for many years Mr. W. Lewis,
bookbinder, the intimate friend of Dr. Smollett, and his fellow
companion, on their journey from Edinburgh to London.&nbsp; It
was by the advice of Smollett that he settled at Chelsea; he is
pourtrayed in the novel of &ldquo;Roderick Random,&rdquo; under
the character of Strap the Barber, and many facetious anecdotes
are there related of his simplicity, vanity, and ignorance of the
world.&nbsp; Mr. Lewis died about 1785.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Danvers Street was begun to be built in the latter end of the
17th century, on the site of Danvers Gardens, and from thence
takes its name.&nbsp; Danvers House adjoined Sir Thomas
More&rsquo;s estate, if it was not actually a part of his
property, or that of his son in-law, Roper; there existed
anciently a thoroughfare or private way between the houses in
Lombard Street, on the north side, towards the King&rsquo;s Road,
but to what extent cannot now be ascertained.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir John Danvers, who possessed this property as early as the
reign of Elizabeth, was the younger brother of Sir H. Danvers,
created Earl of Danby in 1625, and by reason of his noble <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>birth was
made Gentleman Usher to King Charles the First.&nbsp; In this
promotion, having more pride than wit, he lived above his income,
and finding himself plunged deeply in debt, and discarded by his
family and his Sovereign for associating with the seditious, and
propagating their principles about the Court, he, with hopes of
gain, and of protection from his creditors, joined the rebels,
always embraced the religion of the prevailing party, and at last
submitted to that base office, to assist with his presence in the
mock court of justice, and, with his hand and seal to the warrant
annexed, to take away the life of that king whose bread he had
eaten; being induced thereto (as a writer of that period states)
chiefly through an expectation of ousting his brother, and
seizing upon his estate for his own use, by the same authority
and power as so unjustly cut off his Majesty&rsquo;s head.&nbsp;
He died a natural death in 1659, before the restoration.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir John married Magdalen, daughter of Sir Richard Newport,
and relict of Sir Richard Herbert, by whom she was mother of the
famous Lord Herbert of Cherbury.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the death of her first husband this lady continued a
widow twelve years, and was highly esteemed for her great and
harmless wit, cheerful gravity, and obliging behaviour, which
gained her an acquaintance and friendship with most people of
eminent worth or learning in the University of Oxford, where she
lived four years, to take care of the education of her eldest
son, her children being all young at the death of their
father.&nbsp; She died in 1627, and was buried at Chelsea.&nbsp;
The Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, whilst preaching her funeral
sermon, could not refrain from tears, as Walton reports, who was
present.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Danvers House passed from the Danvers family to the Hon. T.
Wharton, who, by Queen Anne, in 1714, was created Marquis of
Wharton.&nbsp; The house was pulled down about 1716.&nbsp; The
garden and grounds extended to the King&rsquo;s Road;
considerable remains of this house were discovered on the site of
Paultons Square in 1822, consisting of the foundations of walls,
the remains of the great bath, and various fragments of stone
pillars and capitals, the whole covering a great space of land,
but being considered by the proprietor, Mr. Shepherd, nurseryman,
too extensive to take up, they were again covered with
earth.&nbsp; It was Sir John Danvers who first introduced into
this country the Italian method of horticulture, of which his
garden was a most beautiful specimen.&nbsp; Against the wall of
the house at the south <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>end of Danvers Street, is placed a
stone thus inscribed:&mdash;&ldquo;This is Danvers Street, begun
in ye year 1696 by Benjamin Stafford.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1742 this
was a public house, the sign of the Bell, which was suspended
across the street.&nbsp; The house at the south-west corner was
also, it is said, formerly a public house, known by the sign of
the Angel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Duke Street, as already indirectly intimated, was first built
at the time when the Duke of Buckingham resided at the
&ldquo;greatest house in Chelsea,&rdquo; and was thus named in
compliment to that nobleman.&nbsp; There is nothing clearly known
as to the origin of Lombard Street.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Luke Thomas Flood, Esq., first resided in Cheyne Walk, but
afterwards removed to the spacious house at the western corner of
Beaufort Street, fronting the river.&nbsp; He was a very great
benefactor to the parish, an active and intelligent magistrate,
and interested himself in promoting at all times whatever was
conducive to the welfare and improvement of Chelsea.&nbsp; He was
treasurer of the Parish Schools for many years, and, in 1818,
through his indefatigable exertions, he succeeded in nearly
doubling the number of children that had attended them, and who
were clothed and educated free of expense to their parents.&nbsp;
Towards the close of his life he went to Brighton, where he
remained till his death, which occurred about 1860.&nbsp; His
munificent annual gifts to the poor of this parish, as bequeathed
in his will, but which he desired to be at once carried into
effect, during his remaining days, will cause his memory to be
revered in this parish by all future generations.&nbsp; Mr. Flood
possessed some valuable pictures by the most eminent Masters.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles Hatchett, Esq., resided in the adjoining house, known
as Belle Vue House.&nbsp; It was built by his father, in
1771.&nbsp; In it was a small but choice collection of pictures,
amongst which were two landscapes, by Salvator Rosa; a Madonna
and Child, by Andrea del Sarto; a beautiful small landscape, by
Van Goen; another by Ferg, and a large one by George Barrett,
R.A., with cattle, by the elder Mr. Gilpin.&nbsp; A very
excellent portrait of Mrs. Hatchett, by Gainsborough; and a
picture, supposed to be by Giovanni Bellini, the subject &ldquo;a
Dead Christ and Holy Family.&rdquo;&nbsp; The library was very
extensive, containing many valuable editions of the Greek and
Latin Classics, a numerous series of historical works, and the
voluminous Transactions and Memoirs of the Royal Society.&nbsp;
The collection of manuscript <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>and printed music was also very
considerable.&nbsp; Mr. Hatchett was the author of several works
on chemical science, and was a magistrate for the county.&nbsp;
He contributed to most of the local charities, and as a private
gentleman was much respected.&nbsp; He died in 1846, at an
advanced age.</p>
<h3>Lindsey House, the Moravians, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>This ancient mansion stands also in front of the river, and
adjoined Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was erected by the
Earl of Lindsey, in the reign of Charles II., on the site of a
house originally built by Sir Theodore Mayerne, an eminent
physician, and the only instance on record of a physician who was
retained in that character by four kings.&nbsp; He lived many
years in Chelsea, and died here at the age of 82.&nbsp; At his
death, Robert, Earl of Lindsey, purchased the house, which he
pulled down, and erected the present edifice; it has, however,
undergone great alterations by subsequent proprietors, and is now
divided into five houses.&nbsp; The Earl of Lindsey died in 1701,
but his widow resided here till 1705.&nbsp; In the same year
Lindsey House was occupied by Ursula, Countess Dowager of
Plymouth, and by her son, Lord Windsor.&nbsp; It was afterwards
in the possession of Francis, Lord Conway, the second son of Sir
E. Seymour, who was created a peer in 1703.&nbsp; By his third
wife, Charlotte, sister to Lady Walpole, he had Francis, Marquis
of Hertford, who was born at Chelsea in 1718.&nbsp; The house
continued in the Ancaster family till 1750, when it was purchased
for the Moravian Society.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Count Zinzendorf, who was the purchaser, formed an intention
of establishing a settlement at Chelsea for the Moravians, and
took a plot of ground to erect a large building for the reception
of three hundred families, to carry on a manufactory; and,
besides possessing Lindsey House, he also purchased a piece of
ground, part of the gardens of Beaufort House, for a burial
ground, together with the stables belonging to that old mansion,
and likewise a slip of ground to erect a chapel.&nbsp; The chapel
was fitted up, but the settlement, which was to be called Sharon,
failed.&nbsp; The house was, however, inhabited by some of the <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>society.&nbsp; Count Zinzendorf himself lived there, and
presided over the community as long as he dwelt in England.&nbsp;
In 1754 an English provincial Synod was held here, at which the
minister of the brethren&rsquo;s church at London, John Gambold,
a divine greatly esteemed for his piety and learning by several
English bishops, who were his cotemporaries at Oxford, was
consecrated a bishop of the church of the brethren; he had
previously published a hymn book for the children belonging to
the brethren&rsquo;s congregation, printed entirely with his own
hands at Lindsey House.&nbsp; The inmates of the house consisted
chiefly of Germans and missionaries, for whose use the Count
principally intended the establishment, that they might make it a
sort of caravansera or resting place when they arrived in this
country, in passing to or from their various missionary
establishments in the British dominions.&nbsp; The panels of the
great staircase, being wainscotted, were painted by Haidt, a
celebrated German artist; there were also in the house several
admirable portraits.&nbsp; The house was sold by the society in
1770.&nbsp; There has not been any other settlement for the
Moravians since that period.&nbsp; Their church is episcopal and
has been acknowledged as such by Parliament.&nbsp; They live, in
their settlements, like members of one large family; the most
perfect harmony prevails amongst them, and they seem to have but
one wish at heart, the propagation of the Gospel and the general
good of mankind.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Moravian Burial Ground, the entrance to which is at the
north end of Milman&rsquo;s Row, occupies about two acres of
ground.&nbsp; The whole is divided into four distinct
compartments.&nbsp; The brethren are buried in separate divisions
from those of the sisters; for, as in their public assemblies,
they still adhere to the ancient custom of separating the sexes,
the men occupying one, and the women the other side of the
chapel, so they retain it even in their burying ground.&nbsp; The
tomb-stones are all flat, placed on turf, raised about six inches
above the ground, in regular rows.&nbsp; The inscriptions in
general record only the names and age of the persons
interred.&nbsp; Amongst them are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>William Hammond, 1783, formerly a clergyman of the Church of
England; he was of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and was
the author of a book, entitled, &ldquo;The Marrow of the
Gospel,&rdquo; being the substance of some sermons preached
before the University.&nbsp; He was a man of considerable
learning, and <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>an excellent Greek scholar, in which language he wrote
his own life.&nbsp; The late Rev. Mr. La Trobe had the manuscript
in his possession some years ago.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>James Fraser, aged 63, 1808, who made fifty-six voyages
between England and Labrador, in the service of the Moravian
Missions on that coast.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>James Hutton, 1795, of whom there is an engraved portrait in
mezzotinto, with a trumpet to his ear.&nbsp; This worthy and
well-known character was accustomed to pay morning visits to some
of the first families in Chelsea; he used likewise to seek out
objects that were in distress, and relieved them according to
their necessities.&nbsp; The character of Albany, in Miss
Burney&rsquo;s celebrated novel of Cecilia, is said to be meant
for his portrait.&nbsp; He died in the 80th year of his age.</p>
<p>The Rev. C. J. La Trobe succeeded him as secretary to the
brethren.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>James Gillray, 1799, forty years sexton at this cemetery,
father of Gillray the celebrated caricaturist, whose works are so
much admired for their spirit and effect.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>P&aelig;trus B&aelig;hler, 1770.&nbsp; A very active Minister
among the Moravians, and one of their bishops.&nbsp; He came to
England in 1738, was very intimate with Wesley and Whitfield,
whom he visited at Oxford, and who were in the same ship with him
when he went to America as Minister of the Colony of Georgia.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Benjamin La Trobe, 1786, father of the Rev. C. J. La Trobe, a
man of distinguished excellence as a preacher, the editor of
several religious works, and for a long time superintendent of
the congregation in England.&nbsp; He removed many
&ldquo;absurdities which prevailed in their religious
proceedings, and which had subjected the whole community to
unmerited scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Christian Renatus, Count of Zinzendorf, May 28, 1832.&nbsp;
There is against the south wall of the chapel a tablet to his
memory.&nbsp; He was the only son of the celebrated Count
Zinzendorf.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mary Theresa Stonehouse, daughter of Sir John Crisp, Bart.,
and wife of the Rev. George Stonehouse, 1751.&nbsp; This monument
is on the right of the preceding.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>In this
cemetery also lies buried an Esquimaux Indian, called
Nunak.&nbsp; As he had not been baptized, he was not permitted to
lie in the same division with the community, but was placed
outside the walk under an elm tree, having an inscription to his
memory in the same style as the rest of the Brethren.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The burial service of the church is particularly
impressive.&nbsp; The coffin being deposited in the middle of the
chapel, a hymn is sung by the congregation, for they value and
carefully cultivate music as a science, and the responses of
their liturgies are attended with peculiar effect.&nbsp; The
Minister then delivers a discourse, in which some account is
given of the deceased, with suitable exhortations.&nbsp; The form
of service contained in their Liturgy is next read, and the
congregation then follow the corpse, the men walking together,
and the women the same.&nbsp; A scriptural passage is read,
commencing as follows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Meanwhile none of us liveth
to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and
whether we die, we die unto the Lord,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The
following is then sung by the congregation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Now to the earth let these remains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hope committed be,<br />
Until the body, chang&rsquo;d, obtains<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blest immortality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the above verse is being sung the body is let down into
the grave.&nbsp; A prayer is then offered, and the whole is
concluded by singing a verse of another hymn.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The chapel at the north side of the burial ground occupies the
site of the old stables of Beaufort House.&nbsp; It is a plain
building, displaying no architectural adornments, and it is now
upwards of fifty years since Divine service was performed in it
by the brethren.&nbsp; For a long time it has been occupied as a
schoolroom for the boys belonging to Park Chapel National and
Sunday Schools, and most of the annual meetings of the numerous
societies, which are supported by the congregation of Park
Chapel, are at present held in it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The house adjoining the entrance to the Moravian Chapel and
Burial Ground, some few years since pulled down, was for many
years in the occupation of the Howard family, of the Society of
Friends.&nbsp; The elder Mr. Howard was gardener to Sir Hans
Sloane; his brother having a natural genius for <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>mechanics,
became a clockmaker, and made the clock in the Old Church, in
1761, for the sum of &pound;50.&nbsp; In the front of
Howard&rsquo;s house was placed a large clock, and hence the
origin of the appellation, &ldquo;Clock House,&rdquo; as now
applied to what was once the Moravian chapel.</p>
<h3>LINDSEY ROW.</h3>
<p>It was mentioned at the commencement of the description of
Lindsey House, that it had been divided into five houses, called
Lindsey Row.&nbsp; These houses still remain, and are inhabited
at the present time by families of great respectability.&nbsp;
They command a most delightful prospect of the Thames, which here
forms a sort of bay; the view from the upper stories is bounded
on the south by the Surrey Hills, and Putney Heath on the
north.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry Constantine Jennings, Esq., a most eccentric and
unfortunate gentleman, resided in the first house on the
east.&nbsp; He was born in 1731, and was descended from a very
ancient and illustrious family, the Nevils.&nbsp; The celebrated
Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, he reckoned among his
progenitors.&nbsp; At an early age he obtained a commission in
the first regiment of Foot Guards, and afterwards went abroad on
his travels.&nbsp; While in Italy, he formed an acquaintance with
the Duke of Marlborough, then Marquis of Blandford, and it is
said he suggested the idea of the cabinet of antiques, afterwards
engraved by Bartolozzi, and so well known as the Marlborough
Gems.&nbsp; It was at this period, doubtless, that Mr. Jennings
acquired a passion for objects of taste.&nbsp; On his return to
England, he repaired to his seat at Shiplake, in the county of
Oxford, and unfortunately for him became addicted to the
pleasures of the turf, and the result was that his fortune was
soon dissipated.&nbsp; Mr. Jennings now withdrew from society and
lived in obscurity.&nbsp; A sudden change of fortune seems,
however, to have released him from pecuniary difficulties, for we
find him collecting, with great ardour, every object of
antiquity, &amp;c., that was presented to his notice, and which
he could purchase.&nbsp; He also possessed a most valuable
library.&nbsp; But, again, he became reduced in his
circumstances, and had to dispose of his books and collections at
a vast loss.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>From
this time but few particulars are known of Mr. Jennings, until he
settled at Lindsey Row, about 1792.&nbsp; Here he continued to
reside, fully occupied as an antiquary, a virtuoso, and an
author, until, at length, his health began to decline, and his
fortune daily became deteriorated, in consequence of his
inordinate passion for collecting objects of taste; at last he
closed his eccentric career a prisoner within the rules of the
King&rsquo;s Bench, where he expired February 7, 1819, aged
88.</p>
<p>This remarkable gentleman, whom I well remember, seemed more
properly to belong to some distant generation rather than the one
in which he lived&mdash;his character, dress, and manners, were
so different in every respect.&nbsp; The fate of such a man, to a
certain extent, awakens our sympathy, for his pursuits were
generally throughout his life most refined; and the disasters
which befel him is a warning to many in the present day.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Jennings&rsquo;s Museum well deserves to be noticed.&nbsp;
It consisted of a rare and valuable collection of the most chosen
specimens of taste, and probably the completest collection of
shells.&nbsp; Many fine specimens of minerals and scarce coloured
gems, cameos, and intaglios; crystals, and other choice
productions of nature, such as diamonds of almost every colour,
rubies, emeralds, pearls, sapphires, &amp;c.; not to omit many
excellent specimens of well-preserved birds and quadrupeds.&nbsp;
Old, and first-rate impressions of prints from Raphael, and
others of the Roman school; some fine specimens of sculpture,
both ancient and modern; many fine and scarce impressions of
first editions, classical and of the entertaining kind, with many
original drawings and pictures; in short, all that could interest
one who had been long a real amateur.&nbsp; Among the portraits
was a fine one of Mary, Queen of Scotland, and another of Titian
and his Mistress, the Mary in her fourteenth year; likewise
several rare enamel miniatures of interesting characters; among
which was one of the Princess Elizabeth, about seventeen years of
age, this latter by Holbein; with some well-preserved medals in
gold and silver.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This collection was disposed of by auction, by Mr. Phillips,
in 1820; the shells, and most valuable articles, being removed to
Bond Street, and the preserved birds, quadrupeds, and other
articles of rarity, together with the furniture, were sold at
Lindsey Row.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>T.
Bonner, Esq., a gentleman much respected in the parish, resided
in Lindsey Row for many years.&nbsp; Mrs. Bonner was at all times
most active in relieving the necessitous and deserving
poor.&nbsp; She occupied the house some time after the death of
her husband, and died a few years ago.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Mark Isombard Brunell, the originator and designer of the
Thames Tunnel, resided for a considerable period in the centre
house.&nbsp; His public works will immortalize his name to the
latest posterity, as being one of the most eminent engineers of
the present century.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Martin, R.A., K.L., so well known for those
grandly-conceived and sublime compositions, &ldquo;Joshua
commanding the Sun to stand Still,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fall of
Nineveh,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Last Judgment,&rdquo; &amp;c., also
resided in Lindsey Row for some years.&nbsp; The late Prince
Consort was a frequent visitor to his Studio, and it is a
pleasing fact to record that Mr. Martin kindly permitted the
neighbouring inhabitants, and others, to have access occasionally
to it, accompanied by an attendant, during his absence from
home.&nbsp; He died, as will be remembered, not many years
since.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Timothy Bramah, Esq., a distinguished engineer, likewise
occupied a house in Lindsey Row, for some years.&nbsp; The family
was always greatly respected, and a member of it still resides in
a house near the one where Mr. Bramah resided.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Bramah Lock&rdquo; at once denotes the celebrity of the
firm.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. James Hutchins, M.A., who succeeded his father, the
Rev. John Hutchins, as Evening Lecturer at the Old Church,
resided for some years at a house at the western corner of
Milman&rsquo;s Row, fronting the river.&nbsp; Mr. Hutchins, the
son, was also Evening Lecturer at the new St. Luke&rsquo;s Church
for several years.&nbsp; The Lecturer was remunerated by
voluntary contributions, chiefly, collected from the inhabitants
throughout the parish, the average amount altogether being about
&pound;60 per annum.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Milman&rsquo;s Row, which nearly adjoins Lindsey Row, and
which might now with great propriety be called Milman Street,
leads to the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It derives its name from
Sir William Milman, who died in 1713, the estate having been for
some years in his possession.&nbsp; The ancient parsonage-house
and grounds, which were exchanged by the Rector in 1566, with the
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Marquis of
Winchester, for the present Rectory, stood upon this spot.&nbsp;
Strewan House, which is on the western side of Milman&rsquo;s
Row, has been occupied at different periods by many
highly-respectable families.&nbsp; It is now in the possession of
George Berry, Esq.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The foundry, which belonged to a person of the name of
Janeway, was situated near World&rsquo;s End Passage.&nbsp; It
was very extensive, and here the old bells of the Church were
re-cast in 1759.&nbsp; Riley Street, which stands on part of the
foundry ground, was built principally in 1790.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Patrick Gibson, aged 111 years, lived in a house near the old
World&rsquo;s End Tavern.&nbsp; For many years this remarkable
man was a purser in the navy, in the reign of George III., and on
all occasions he was invariably found in the thick of the battle,
fighting with the most determined bravery.&nbsp; He assisted in
conveying General Wolfe off the field, and served under Lord
Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar.&nbsp; William IV., when Duke
of Clarence, visited him at Chelsea, and took great interest in
his affairs.&nbsp; He resided in the parish 20 years, and died in
1832, at the remarkable age of 111 years, which was proved to be
correct from official dates and by particular events.&nbsp; An
exceedingly striking portrait of Patrick Gibson, by McNaughten,
adorns the walls of Greenwich Hospital.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The World&rsquo;s-End Tavern was a noted house of
entertainment in the reign of Charles II.; the tea-gardens and
grounds were extensive, and elegantly fitted up for the reception
of company.&nbsp; The origin of the sign of the house is
uncertain.&nbsp; It was probably so named on account of its then
considered distance from London, and the bad and dangerous state
of the roads or pathways to it.&nbsp; Most of the visitors came
in pleasure boats along the Thames.&nbsp; This ancient tavern is
particularly mentioned in Congreve&rsquo;s comedy of &ldquo;Love
for Love,&rdquo; in a dialogue between Mrs. Foresight and Mrs.
Frail, in which the former accuses the latter of having been seen
at the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s End.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;I suppose you would
not go alone to the World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;The World&rsquo;s End! what, do you
mean to banter me?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Poor innocent! you don&rsquo;t
know that there is a place called the World&rsquo;s End.&nbsp; I
declare you can keep your countenance&mdash;surely you&rsquo;ll
make an admirable player.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;I declare you have a great deal of
impudence, and, in my mind, too much for the stage..</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span><i>Mrs.
Foresight</i>.&mdash;Very well, that will appear who has
most.&nbsp; You never were at the Word&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;No.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;You deny it positively to my
face?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Your face, what&rsquo;s your
face?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;No matter for that, it is as good
a face as yours.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Not by a dozen years wearing.&nbsp;
But I do deny it, positively, to your face, then.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll allow you now to find
fault with my face; for I declare your impudence has put me out
of countenance.&nbsp; But look you here now; where did you lose
this gold bodkin?&nbsp; Oh, sister! oh, sister!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;My bodkin!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Nay, it is yours&mdash;look at
it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Well, if you go to that, where did
you find this bodkin?&nbsp; Oh, sister! sister! sister every
way!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Oh! bother on&rsquo;t that I
could not discover her without betraying myself.

<p>Joseph Mallard W. Turner, Esq., R.A., resided for some time in
a small house directly facing the Thames, in the road leading to
Cremorne, where he died in 1851.&nbsp; No doubt he selected this
spot on account of the attractive scenery on the river, and the
fine view of some parts of Surrey, as also to enjoy for a time
the benefits arising from a more secluded life.&nbsp; At the age
of thirty years, Mr. Turner was recognised as the first landscape
painter of the day.&nbsp; For a period of sixty years he
contributed to every exhibition of the Royal Academy, sending in
all 259 pictures.&nbsp; For many years he refused to part with
some of the choicest specimens of his art, and after his death it
was found that he had left those to the English nation, together
with a great number of drawings and engravings.&nbsp; Mr. Turner,
while residing here, lived in almost entire seclusion.&nbsp; He
would not see any person, excepting a few very intimate friends,
and, in fact, was extremely anxious not to be recognized.&nbsp;
This inclination, at the close of his life, was very
natural.&nbsp; The world is indebted to him for his productions,
and Chelsea is proud to add his name to its list of distinguished
residents.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The roadway in front of the house occupied by Mr. Turner, and
along the front of that part of the river, has been considerably
widened, and now presents a well-formed embankment.&nbsp; A
handsome terrace has been erected, besides a number of houses on
the adjoining ground.</p>
<h3><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CREMORNE HOUSE.</h3>
<p>This villa was first formed by Theophilus, Earl of Huntingdon,
who died in 1746.&nbsp; It afterwards belonged, successively, to
Richard, Viscount Powerscourt; to the Countess Dowager of Exeter,
relict of Brownlow, the eighth Earl; and to Sir Richard
Lyttleton, who married the Dowager Duchess of Bridgewater, and
died in 1770.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the death of the Duchess, in 1777, Thomas Dawson,
Viscount Cremorne, at that time Baron Dartrey, purchased the
villa in 1778.&nbsp; He considerably enlarged and embellished the
premises, under the skill of the eminent Mr. James Wyatt.&nbsp;
His lordship died in Stanhope Street, Mayfair, in 1813, in his
89th year, greatly respected, and bequeathed the estate to his
relict, the late Viscountess.&nbsp; It is stated, in an account
published shortly after Lord Cremorne&rsquo;s death, that
&ldquo;his generosity was unbounded, and his heart, in the most
comprehensive sense, charitable.&nbsp; But his most excellent
character is, that he was a Christian in mind and
practice.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Dowager Viscountess Cremorne, born in Philadelphia in
1740, died at her house in Stanhope Street in 1825, in the 86th
year of her age.&nbsp; Her ladyship resided at Chelsea a great
portion of the year, and kept a large establishment.&nbsp; She
was one of the most kind-hearted residents in the parish.&nbsp;
For years it was her custom to entertain annually the children of
the parochial and other schools, and she patronized the tradesmen
of Chelsea as far as it was practicable, giving special orders to
that effect to her household.&nbsp; Queen Charlotte occasionally
visited her in the summer months, when the children again
attended, and received tokens of her benevolent regard for
them.&nbsp; She was buried by the side of her husband in the
family vault at Stoke.&nbsp; The carriages of the Royal Family
followed in the funeral procession for some distance, and most of
the tradesmen closed their shops.&nbsp; She bequeathed the villa
to her first cousin and executor, Granville Penn, Esq., second
surviving son of Thomas Penn, and brother of John Penn, Esqrs.,
of Stoke Park, Bucks, Hereditary Governors and Proprietaries of
the Province of Pennsylvania.&nbsp; Granville Penn, Esq., resided
in it for a few years.&nbsp; It would occupy too much space to
give a sketch even of the history of this distinguished
family.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Lord
and Lady Cremorne possessed a very fine and extensive collection
of paintings, which were sold by auction, on the premises, in
1827.&nbsp; Amongst them was a copy of Correggio&rsquo;s picture
of the Madonna and Child, and St. Jerome at Parma, by Copley,
full size, and accounted the best copy of that celebrated
picture.&nbsp; The late Lord Lyndhurst purchased it.&nbsp; The
grounds, &amp;c., are now known as Cremorne Gardens, but this
once pretty villa can scarcely now be recognised as the favourite
residence of Lord and Lady Cremorne.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Ashburnham House is situated to the west of the late Lord
Cremorne&rsquo;s premises.&nbsp; Dr. Benjamin Hoadley built the
house, in 1747, for his own residence, but it has since been
greatly altered by different occupiers.&nbsp; He was the eldest
son of the Bishop of Winchester, and was a Fellow of the Royal
Society when very young.&nbsp; In the learned world he was known
as a philosopher.&nbsp; Dr. Hoadley was also an eminent
physician.&nbsp; At his death Hoadley House was purchased by Sir
Richard Glynn, who sold it to the Earl of Ashburnham, and thence
it obtained the name of Ashburnham House.&nbsp; It was next in
possession of that learned physician, Dr. Cadogan, who resided in
it for a few years, and planted in the garden a large quantity of
medicinal herbs.&nbsp; Lady Mary Coke resided here for about ten
years, and sold it to Mr. Brown, who occupied a house near to it,
called Ashburnham Cottage.&nbsp; Mr. Stevens at length possessed
the house, and resided in it for many years.&nbsp; Afterwards it
was the residence of the Hon. Leicester Stanhope, subsequently
Earl of Harrington.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the banks of the river, in front of Ashburnham House, was a
piece of land, called the Lots.&nbsp; The Lammas rights of the
parishioners, with respect to this land, are now extinct.&nbsp;
Those who wish to know the particulars, will find them fully
recorded in the Annual Vestry Reports, which may be obtained at
the Vestry Hall, and which will render many parochial details in
this work quite unnecessary.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the south side of the King&rsquo;s Road, and near to the
boundary line which divides the parishes of Chelsea and Fulham,
is Dudmarton House, which was for a considerable period the
residence of Samuel Gower Poole, Esq., who erected a chapel on
the premises, where he occasionally preached, and amongst others
the Rev. Dr. Jay, of Bath, the Rev. John and Charles Hyatt, the
Rev. Dr. Collyer, &amp;c.&nbsp; The Rev. Dr. Raffles, it is <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>stated,
preached his first sermon there when he was quite a youth.&nbsp;
Mr. Poole also established a school for the education of poor
boys, many of whom were clothed through his exertions.</p>
<h3>Stanley House, St. Mark&rsquo;s College.</h3>
<p>Near to what is now the Chelsea Railway Station, on the north
of the King&rsquo;s Road, is Stanley House.&nbsp; In the reign of
Queen Elizabeth this was part of the estate of Sir Arthur Gorges,
who was knighted in 1597, and died in 1625, and who built a house
on this site for his own residence.&nbsp; Rowland White, writing
to Sir Robert Sidney, Nov. 15, 1599, says, &ldquo;As the Queen
passed by the faire new building, Sir Arthur Gorges presented her
with a faire jewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The family of Gorges at this
period possessed very considerable property in Chelsea, which
they afterwards gradually disposed of to the Cheyne family and
others.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Arthur Gorges was the intimate friend of Spenser, who
lamented the death of the first Lady Gorges, daughter of Viscount
Bindon, and who died in 1590, in a beautiful elegy, entitled
Daphnaida; he has recorded likewise the conjugal affection and
the talents of her husband, under the name of Alcyon, in the
following elegant lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And there is sad Alcyon, bent to mourne<br
/>
Though fit to frame an everlasting dittie;<br />
Whose gentle spright for Daphne&rsquo;s death doth tourne<br />
Sweet lays of love to endlesse plaints of pittie.<br />
Ah! pensive boy, pursue that brave conceipt<br />
In thy sweet eglantine merriflure;<br />
Lift up thy notes unto their wonted height,<br />
That may my muse and mates to mirth allure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Arthur married, secondly, Lady Elizabeth, daughter of
Henry, Earl of Lincoln, by which marriage he became possessed of
Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s house, which, in 1619, he conveyed to
Lionel, Lord Cranfield.&nbsp; He died in 1625, leaving by his
second wife six children.&nbsp; Lady Elizabeth Gorges, his widow,
in 1637, <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>sold this estate to her daughter, Lady Elizabeth
Stanley, widow of Sir Robert Stanley, and confirmed the same by
her will in 1643, in which year she died.&nbsp; The family of
Stanley appear to have held possession of this estate, and
resided here till the latter end of the seventeenth century, when
this branch of it became extinct, in the male line, by the death
of William Stanley, Esq. in 1691.&nbsp; The house was rebuilt
about this period; and, being left in an unfinished state, was
for several years unoccupied.&nbsp; It belonged, in 1724, to
Henry Arundel, Esq.&nbsp; Admiral Sir Charles Wager died here in
1743.&nbsp; It is said that this gallant officer was educated a
Quaker, and that though he left that society, he was always
particularly kind to its members.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After passing through several hands, Stanley House became the
property of Miss Southwell, afterwards the lady of Sir James
Eyre, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, who sold it in 1777
to the Countess of Strathmore, one of the most intelligent female
botanists of the age.&nbsp; Her ladyship had begun to build
extensive hothouses and conservatories, brought exotics from the
Cape, and was continually raising an increase to her collections,
when, by an unfortunate marriage, the cruel spoiler came, and
threw them like loathsome weeds away.&nbsp; The Countess married
A. R. Bowes, Esq., whose barbarities to her exceeded every thing
recorded in the annals of crime, and drew upon him the
execrations of the whole country. <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; After
suffering innumerable indignities from her husband, the Countess
exhibited articles of the peace against him in the Court of
King&rsquo;s Bench, and obtained a separation, under heavy
securities.&nbsp; She passed the remainder of her days in much
affliction, both in body and mind, and departed this life on the
20th April, 1800.&nbsp; Bowes died miserably in a jail.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Stanley House was purchased of the Countess of Strathmore, by
Mr. Lochee, who kept the Military Academy at Little Chelsea, and
was for some time in the occupation of Richard Warren, M.D.&nbsp;
This eminent physician was the son of the Rev. Richard Warren,
Archdeacon of Suffolk.&nbsp; He died in 1797, and was buried in
the chancel of Kensington Church, where a monument, with a Latin
inscription, was erected to his memory.</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>About
the year 1815, Stanley House was purchased by William Hamilton,
Esq., who resided in it for some time, and made great additions
to the original structure, by building a picture gallery on the
east side.&nbsp; He had a good collection of paintings, a capital
portrait of his father, the Rev. Dr. Hamilton, Vicar of St.
Martin&rsquo;s in the Fields, and many fine casts of the Elgin
marbles.&nbsp; In 1822, Mr. Hamilton was appointed Envoy to the
Court of Naples, and during his absence from Chelsea, he let the
house to some distinguished families, amongst them may be
mentioned the Marquis of Queensbury.&nbsp; Mr. Hamilton
afterwards sold the estate to the National Society.</p>
<h3>ST. MARK&rsquo;S COLLEGE.</h3>
<p>Stanley House, as it was formerly called, became the residence
of the Principal of St. Mark&rsquo;s College, which was
established by the National Society, in the year 1841, as a
Training Institution for Schoolmasters, in connexion with the
Church of England.&nbsp; To the Rev. Derwent Coleridge, M.A., the
first Principal of the College, must be attributed the eminent
position it has attained among the educational institutions of
the country.&nbsp; He was the Principal of the College for a
period of twenty-three years, and greatly beloved by the
Students, popular among his Colleagues and Assistants, and
enjoyed the respect and confidence of the Council, who had the
pleasant task of co-operating with him.&nbsp; In January, 1864,
he was presented by the late Bishop of London to the Rectory of
Hanwell, which occasioned his resignation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Many candidates of great eminence were desirous to become the
Rev. Mr. Coleridge&rsquo;s successor, and from among them the
Rev. John G. Cromwell, M.A., Hon. Canon of Durham, and formerly
Scholar of Brasenose College, Oxford, was selected, his
testimonials being of the very highest order, and his successful
administration of the Training College at Durham, during 12
years, appeared to the Council a sufficient guarantee for his
success at St. Mark&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This expectation has now been
happily fully realized.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>The
Vice-Principal is the Rev. C. F. Eastburn, M.A., Fellow of St.
John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and the Rev. C. S. Dawe, B.A.,
is the Normal Master in the College, and Head Master of the
School, and, from the testimony of those who are well-qualified
to form an impartial opinion, they most efficiently discharge
their respective arduous duties, and this just acknowledgment
equally applies to the Tutors, Mr. W. Lawson, F.R.G.S., and Mr.
O. Breden.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the west side of the house the National Society added a
quadrangle, built in the Italian style, and in the grounds, near
the chapel, an octagon building as a Practising School, for
teaching children who reside in the locality.&nbsp; The grounds
of the College consist of eleven acres of garden and grass
land.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Upper School gives a superior education to 160 boys, who
are instructed in all the usual branches of an English education,
and also in Latin and French.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Middle School gives a similar education, with the
exception of Latin and French, to 180 boys.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Lower School is intended for the sons of the humbler
classes, and gives sound instruction in elementary subjects to
200 boys.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is accommodation in the College for 100 Students, who
are being trained here for Schoolmasters.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chapel stands close to the Fulham Road, and is open to the
public twice every day, at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.&nbsp; On Sundays the
Services begin at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.&nbsp; The seats are free,
and the expenses are defrayed by voluntary contributions.&nbsp;
There is no endowment of any kind.&nbsp; The exterior of the
building is unpretending.&nbsp; The interior has a distinctive
character given to it by the windows of stained glass, which
produce an impression of warmth and beauty.&nbsp; There is an
excellent organ and a full choir, composed of the Students and a
certain number of boys from the schools.&nbsp; The Services are
all choral, and on Sundays are usually well attended.&nbsp; On
the anniversary of the College foundation, St. Mark&rsquo;s Day,
April 25, a sermon is preached and a collection made on behalf of
the Chapel Funds, and the surrounding gentry and clergy, together
with the former Students, are invited to a banquet.&nbsp; At the
last Anniversary Festival the sermon was preached by the Dean of
<a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>St.
Paul&rsquo;s, the text being selected from Luke iv. 16.&nbsp; In
the evening, in the Lecture Hall of the College, selections from
an Oratorio and other pieces were admirably rendered by the
Students, under the direction of the Rev. T. Helmore, precentor,
and John Hullah, Esq., to a crowded and most fashionable
audience, and many of the old Students of the College.&nbsp; We
must also mention E. C. May, Esq., to whom much of the
proficiency of the choir may be justly attributed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We will pass by Mr. Veitch&rsquo;s Royal Exotic Nursery, and
the extensive Show Establishment belonging to Messrs. Weeks &amp;
Co., both of which will probably be noticed in a subsequent part
of this work, when a more general notice will be taken of the
entire King&rsquo;s Road, and merely observe that a great number
of villas, and many superior dwelling houses, have been erected
within the last few years in this immediate locality.&nbsp; As
examples of such instances it is only necessary to mention the
splendid house built by John Weeks, Esq., in Edith Grove, and
those in Gunter Grove, Maude Grove, &amp;c., in addition to which
many more well-built houses are now being erected in the
neighbourhood.</p>
<h3>WEST BROMPTON CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH.</h3>
<p>This structure is worthy of special notice.&nbsp; It stands on
a valuable freehold site, and was erected in 1866, at a cost of
between &pound;5000 and &pound;6000, exclusive of the site.&nbsp;
It has sittings for 1100, and owes its existence to the exertions
of the present pastor, the Rev. C. Winter, who had previously
preached for some time in a small chapel in Gunter Grove.&nbsp;
The style adopted is Gothic, of the geometric decorative
period.&nbsp; The building is faced with Kentish ragstone, and
all the dressings are of Boxhill buttstone.&nbsp; The design
consists of three central door-ways, with a large five-light
traceried window over, and traceried side light; separate
entrances to the staircases with panelled parapets and side roofs
over; the sides and chancel end of the building are of brick; the
windows in two tiers with stone dressings; the upper tier
consists of circular traceried windows, and the whole design is
such as to produce a very pleasing effect, which will be much
increased when the tower and spire <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>are carried up as intended.&nbsp; The
building is entered in front by the doors before mentioned, and a
spacious vestibule leads through inner lobbies to the body of the
church, which occupies an area of 70 ft. by 50 ft., but including
chancel and entrance lobbies its length is 106 ft.&nbsp; The
building is surrounded on three sides with spacious galleries,
supported by iron columns, handsomely decorated, running up to
and supporting the roof.&nbsp; The ceiling is divided into bays
by wood spandril arches springing from column to column, and from
the columns to the walls.&nbsp; The chancel arch is a very
effective piece of coloured brickwork, and the chancel recess is
arranged with its windows and angular plan so as to add much to
the general effect, which is considerably increased by a very
handsome memorial window, the gift of the family of Mr. Pitts,
one of the deacons of the church.&nbsp; The building is lighted
by star-lights of an improved design suspended from the
roof.&nbsp; The pulpit, which is spacious and handsome, is of
Caen stone and stands on a platform, around which the seats are
arranged concentrically, a great improvement on the ordinary
rectangular pewing.&nbsp; The larger room under the chancel is
devoted to a variety of useful purposes, such as Infant School,
Sunday Schools, Day School, &amp;c.&nbsp; The chapel in Gunter
Grove has been converted into a Public Hall, and ultimately no
doubt will prove of general use to the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The
Sunday Schools, one of which is held at the Hall, number about
300 children.</p>
<h3>LITTLE CHELSEA, OR WEST BROMPTON.</h3>
<p>Proceeding a little to the north-west, we arrive at what was
formerly called Little Chelsea, but which is now designated West
Brompton.&nbsp; Without wishing to remove our neighbour&rsquo;s
land-mark, or to trespass beyond the precise boundaries of
Chelsea, the parish of Kensington being on the north side of West
Brompton, we will notice the residence of William Boscawen, Esq.,
who resided near to those spacious mansions now being erected on
the grounds formerly known as Walnut-Tree Walk, now called
Redcliffe Gardens.&nbsp; Mr. Boscawen was the younger son of
General George Boscawen, and was born in 1752.&nbsp; At an early
age he was sent to Eton, where he obtained <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the
particular notice and favour of the celebrated Dr. Barnard.&nbsp;
From Eton he removed to Exeter College, Oxford, and afterwards
studied the law, became a member of the Middle Temple, and was
called to the bar.&nbsp; His legal studies were not unfruitful,
as he published an excellent book under the title of &ldquo;A
Treatise of Conviction on Penal Statutes,&rdquo; &amp;c., 1792,
8vo.&nbsp; In 1785 he was appointed a Commissioner of the
Victualling Office, in consequence of which he soon after quitted
the bar, and in the following year married a daughter of Dr.
Ibbetson, Archdeacon of St. Albans.&nbsp; Being an excellent
classical scholar, and warmly attached to literary pursuits, Mr.
Boscawen published, in 1793, &ldquo;A Translation of the Odes of
Horace,&rdquo; which, being much approved of, was soon followed
by a Translation of the Satires, Epistles, and Art of
Poetry.&nbsp; In 1801 he published a small volume of Poems, which
displayed an elegant taste, a poetical mind, and a correct
versification, and he was for several years an able coadjutor to
the British Critic.&nbsp; He died, after a short illness, in
1811.&nbsp; That excellent institution, the Literary Fund, he
considered almost as his child, and his affection to it was
testified not only by contribution, but by annual verses in its
praise, and assiduous attendance at its meetings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Lochee&rsquo;s Military Academy was established at this
place about the year 1770, and enjoyed a high degree of
reputation; many of our most eminent military characters received
their education under him.&nbsp; The premises, which were laid
out as a regular fortification, and were opened to view, excited
much attention at the time.&nbsp; Mr. Lochee afterwards,
unfortunately, engaged in the revolutionary troubles which
agitated Flanders in the year 1790, and being taken prisoner by
the Austrians, was condemned to be hanged; he, however, obtained
permission to come to England, to settle his affairs, upon
condition of leaving his only son as a hostage; and upon his
return to the Continent he suffered the punishment of
death.&nbsp; His son, afterwards, married a daughter of the late
Mr. King, an eminent book auctioneer, of King Street, Covent
Garden, and, lamentable to relate, fell by his own hands.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Balloon Ascent in</span> 1784.&mdash;On
the 16th of October, in the above year, an immense concourse of
people assembled at Mr. Lochee&rsquo;s Military Academy, to
witness Mr. Blanchard&rsquo;s ascent in his balloon.&nbsp; The
fields, for a considerable distance <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>round the spot, were crowded with
horse and foot, in consequence of which, a general devastation
took place in the gardens, the crops being either trampled down
or torn up; the turnip grounds were totally despoiled by the
multitude; all the windows and houses were filled with company,
and every roof and tree was crowded with spectators.&nbsp; At
twelve o&rsquo;clock Mr. Blanchard, and Mr. Sheldon, a surgeon,
stepped into the car, and the cords being loosened, the balloon
slowly ascended, when it was discovered that it would be
requisite to throw out some ballast; but before this could be
accomplished, it struck some trees and descended to the
ground.&nbsp; Being lightened, it again ascended, and moved
horizontally about a quarter of a mile, when it made a rapid
direction towards Sunbury, where they alighted, and Mr. Sheldon
reluctantly quitted the car.&nbsp; Mr. Blanchard re-ascended, and
pursued his aerial excursion to Rumsey, Hants, where he
descended, at half-past four in the afternoon, in a meadow, and
still standing in his car.&nbsp; The balloon was first seen over
Abbotswood Common, and appeared about the size of a small
hogshead.&nbsp; Upon his alighting he was jovially
entertained.&nbsp; The day being rather dark, and the atmosphere
low, the balloon was out of sight in about thirty minutes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About the year 1699, the Earl of Shaftesbury purchased an
estate at Little Chelsea, which had formerly been the property of
Sir James Smith, whose widow resided there in 1695.&nbsp; The
Earl rebuilt the house, and generally resided in it during the
sitting of Parliament.&nbsp; He was first charged to the parish
rates in 1700.&nbsp; Locke here wrote part of his
&ldquo;Essay,&rdquo; and Addison several of the Spectators.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Anthony Astley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, the learned
author of &ldquo;The Characteristics,&rdquo; was born in 1671, in
the house of his grandfather, who took such care of his
education, that, at the age of eleven, he is said to have read
with ease both Latin and Greek.&nbsp; In 1683, he was placed at
Winchester School, where he continued till 1686, when he made the
tour of Italy and France.&nbsp; About five years after his return
from Italy, he visited Holland, where he passed much of his time
in the society of Bayle, Le Clerc, and other ingenious men.&nbsp;
Soon after his arrival in England, he became Earl of Shaftesbury,
by the demise of his father, but did not attend the House of
Lords during the first session after he had succeeded to the
peerage; nor did he appear there till his friend, Lord Somers,
sent a messenger to acquaint him <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>with the pending partition treaty in
February, 1701.&nbsp; On the accession of Queen Anne he retired
to Chelsea, to continue his favourite course of study; here he
resided till 1711, when he set out for Italy, and died at Naples
in 1719.&nbsp; His lordship&rsquo;s philosophical writings are
generally known.&nbsp; Of his letters there are several extant,
dated from Chelsea in 1708.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The house was afterwards the residence of Sergeant Wynne, and
of his son, Edward Wynne, author of several Tracts, whose
knowledge and proficiency in polite literature could only be
exceeded by his charity and benevolence.&nbsp; Dying a bachelor
in 1785, his estates, together with his house at Little Chelsea,
and his very valuable library, collected chiefly by his father,
devolved to his brother, the Rev. Luttrell Wynne.&nbsp; This
house was alienated by him to William Virtue.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The parish of St. George, Hanover Square, purchased it in the
year 1787, as an additional workhouse for the poor.&nbsp; An Act
of Parliament passed that year, declares it to be in St.
George&rsquo;s Parish, so long as it shall continue to be
appropriated to its present use.&nbsp; The same act exempts it
from all dues and rates demandable by the Rector and the parish
of Chelsea, on condition of paying to the former &pound;3
3<i>s.</i> per annum, and to the latter &pound;6 13<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir John Cope, Bart., about the year 1700, resided in a large
house at Little Chelsea, according to Bowack, which was
subsequently occupied as a private mad house.&nbsp; The house has
been pulled down, and its site is now called Odell&rsquo;s
Place.&nbsp; Sir John sat for Oxfordshire and Banbury in several
Parliaments.&nbsp; He married Anne, daughter of Mr. William
Booth, by whom he had seven sons, and one daughter.&nbsp; There
are some entries of their baptisms in the Parish Register.&nbsp;
Sir John died January 11th, 1721.&nbsp; His fourth son, Galen,
born at Chelsea, resided there about the time of his
father&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The worthy baronet was a magistrate
for this county, and his name regularly appears for a series of
years affixed, in confirmation of the parochial rates.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Robert Boyle, Esq., a most distinguished philosopher and
chemist, the seventh son of Richard, Earl of Cork, resided, in
1661, at Little Chelsea, and there he was visited by the learned
and eminent of his time.&nbsp; Monsieur de Monconys, in his
Travels, thus mentions a visit which he made to Mr. Boyle at this
place:&mdash;&ldquo;I went after dinner with Mr. Oldenburg <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and my son,
two miles from London, in a stage coach, for five shillings, to a
village called Little Chelsea, to visit Mr. Boyle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After giving an account of several experiments which Mr. Boyle
made in his presence, he thus proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;He has a
very fine laboratory, where he makes all his extracts, and other
operations, one of which he shewed me with salt, which being put
in quite dry with gold leaves sixteen times thicker than that
used by gilders into a crucible on a slow fire, even over a
lighted candle, the salt calcined the gold so perfectly that
water afterwards dissolved them both, and became impregnated with
them in the same manner as with common salt.&nbsp; He possesses a
very fine telescope, and two excellent microscopes, which are
larger than mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Evelyn, in his Diary, has also
recorded a visit to the same place.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went with that
excellent person and philosopher, Sir Robert Murray, to visit Mr.
Boyle at Chelsea, and saw divers effects of the Eolipile for
weighing air.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bishop Burnet, in Mr. Boyle&rsquo;s
funeral sermon, has given an eloquent account of this great
philosopher and scholar.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles, fourth Earl of Orrery, grand-nephew to Mr. Boyle, was
born at Little Chelsea in 1676.&nbsp; He was author of a comedy,
entitled, &ldquo;As you Find it,&rdquo; and of some verses which
discover his wit and poetical genius.&nbsp; Queen Anne created
him a peer of Great Britain in 1711, by the title of Lord Boyle,
of Marston, in the county of Somerset.&nbsp; His lordship died in
1737.&nbsp; He was the improver of that noble instrument the
Orrery, which, in honour of him, was called after his name.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir James Wishart resided in Little Chelsea, and died in May,
1723.&nbsp; He was a native of Scotland, and was made an Admiral
by Queen Anne; in 1710 he became a Lord Commissioner of the
Admiralty, in which year he was returned Member of Parliament for
Portsmouth.&nbsp; The Queen also conferred the honour of
knighthood upon him; but, in the following reign, he lost all his
places, and was dismissed from the service, for favouring the
interest of the Pretender.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Admiral Sir John Balchen, another distinguished naval officer,
resided in Little Chelsea about 1723.&nbsp; He was lost in the
&ldquo;Victory&rdquo; in the year 1744.&nbsp; Sir John sailed, in
July, from Spithead with a strong squadron, in quest of an
opportunity to attack the French fleet at Brest, under the
command of M. de Rochambault.&nbsp; In the Bay of Biscay he was
overtaken by a violent storm that dispersed the ships, and drove
them up <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>the English Channel.&nbsp; Admiral Stewart, with the
greater part of them, arrived at Plymouth; but Sir John
Balchen&rsquo;s own ship, the Victory, which was at that time
considered to be the most beautiful first rate in the world,
foundered at sea; and this brave officer perished, with all his
officers, volunteers, and crew, amounting to eleven hundred
choice seamen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Right Hon. Edward Hyde, third Earl of Clarendon, died at
his house at Little Chelsea in 1723.&nbsp; He married Catherine,
daughter to Henry Lord O&rsquo;Brien, eldest son and heir to the
Earl of Thomond, of Ireland, by whom he had a son and two
daughters.&nbsp; The title descended to the Earl of Rochester,
and soon after became extinct.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Fatal Duel</span>.&mdash;In January, 1784,
a duel was fought in a field near Little Chelsea, between Captain
Charles Mostyn, of the navy, and Captain Clarke, of the African
Corps, which terminated in the death of the former, who was shot
through the heart.&nbsp; The quarrel originated in defence of a
Jew, who went about diverting company, by taking off Mr.
Fox.&nbsp; Some words arising, Captain Clarke demanded an
apology, which Captain Mostyn declined to make to him.&nbsp; Mr.
Mostyn was a gallant officer, only 25 years of age, who, for his
intrepid behaviour, had been made post-captain in the Solitaire,
a French ship of the line, taken by the Ruby.&nbsp; Happily for
the humanity of England, such dark blots on its history are now
for ever erased, by the adoption of more stringent laws and the
advancement of religious and moral principles.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Baldwin Hamey was born in 1600.&nbsp; He retired to Little
Chelsea from the hurry of his profession the year before the Fire
of London, saving thereby his library; he also escaped from the
direful effects of the plague in London.&nbsp; At Chelsea he
contributed largely towards the erection of the church steeple,
and gave the great bell which had his name on it.&nbsp; I may
here state that the first large bells are mentioned by Bede, in
the year 680.&nbsp; Before that period the early British
Christians made use of wooden rattles (sacra ligna) to call the
congregation of the faithful together.&nbsp; Dr. Adam Littleton,
in gratitude to Dr. Hamey for the above benefactions, printed at
the end of the first edition of his Latin Dictionary, a copy of
Latin verses which he dedicated to him.&nbsp; Dr. Hamey was a
great scholar, a philosopher, and an eminent physician.&nbsp; At
his death he bequeathed to the College of Physicians the estate
of Ashlins, in Essex, besides money and books.&nbsp; There is a
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>manuscript
life of him, written about 143 years ago, by his relation, Mr.
Palmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Chemistry,&rdquo; says the biographer,
&ldquo;now began to come into vogue, which Dr. Hamey could not
well be reconciled to, from his Galenical principles, and at his
age.&nbsp; It seemed to him to be a stroke of
quackery.&rdquo;&nbsp; He declined a knighthood, and the offer of
being first physician to Charles II. after his restoration.&nbsp;
The same modesty made him waive the offer of being President of
his beloved College of Physicians, although he had held all other
subordinate offices in it.&nbsp; He died in 1676, and was buried
in the Old Church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Goat and Boots Tavern still stands at the eastern corner
of Park Walk, West Brompton, or Little Chelsea, although from its
age it seems probable that in a few years a new house will be
substituted for it.&nbsp; The sign was originally painted by
Morland, to pay his tavern bill.&nbsp; In old deeds it is called
the Goat.&nbsp; Perhaps poor Morland added the
&ldquo;Boots&rdquo; to the sign to make it more attractive, and
to get a better price from the proprietor, but this is mere
conjecture.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Park Walk, in a very old map of Chelsea, is called
Lovers&rsquo; Walk, and it appears to have been planted with
trees, but from some unknown cause&mdash;surely all the loving
lads and lasses had not left the parish&mdash;it degenerated into
Twopenny Walk.&nbsp; After dark, from its retirement and
seclusion, it was dangerous for persons passing that way.&nbsp;
It has been now for many years a good thoroughfare from the
King&rsquo;s Road to West Brompton, having Park Chapel in a
central position, and houses on both sides of the road.&nbsp;
When the improvement at the bottom of Milman&rsquo;s Row is
entirely completed, there will then be an excellent and
continuous roadway to the river-side.</p>
<h3>Park Chapel, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>This Chapel was so called from being situated within the
precincts of Chelsea Park, which originally formed the northern
part of Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s grounds.&nbsp; It was built in
1718, by Sir Richard Manningham, who, in 1730, granted a lease of
it to the Rev. William Lacey, of Battersea.&nbsp; At that period
there <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>was
only the Old Church, and an additional episcopal place for Divine
worship was needed for the convenience of the residents in Little
Chelsea.</p>

<p>The Rev. J. Gee Smyth, M.A., who it will be seen possessed
Park Chapel in 1802, made very considerable alterations in it
about 1810.&nbsp; It may be said to have been almost rebuilt by
him.&nbsp; The late Mr. Richard Mann, of Chelsea, took a very
correct sketch of the chapel, as altered by Mr. Smyth.&nbsp;
Since 1810, at different times, it has undergone great repairs
and some material improvements.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. John Owen, M.A., was born in London in 1765.&nbsp; He
received his education at St. Paul&rsquo;s School, and removed
from thence to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he
prosecuted his studies with such success as to obtain several
prizes, and to be elected a Fellow of his College.&nbsp; After
taking holy orders, he soon distinguished himself as a preacher,
and attracted the notice of Bishop Porteus, who bestowed on him
the living of Paglesham, in Essex, having previously recommended
him to the Curacy of Fulham, which he held until the <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>decease of
that venerable prelate; and, on his resigning the Lectureship, in
1813, the inhabitants of that parish presented Mr. Owen with a
handsome testimonial of their attachment, as an acknowledgment of
the faithful manner he had discharged his duties.&nbsp; He was
one of the distinguished founders of the British and Foreign
Bible Society, and acted as honorary secretary for eighteen
years.&nbsp; During the whole of this period he most zealously
advocated, in every possible way, the circulation of the Holy
Scriptures, in conjunction with the Rev. Dr. Steinkoff, and the
Rev. Joseph Hughes, M.A., of Battersea.&nbsp; Mr. Owen possessed
great mental talents, both as an extempore preacher and a
writer.&nbsp; He was remarkably quick and correct in his
conceptions, extremely thoughtful in forming his conclusions, and
kind and considerate whenever a sense of duty compelled him to
differ from others in opinion.&nbsp; He wrote the History of the
British and Foreign Bible Society, and other works; and continued
to discharge his sacred duties as Minister of Park Chapel as long
as his health permitted.&nbsp; He died at Ramsgate, the 26th of
September, 1822, in the 57th year of his age.&nbsp; He resided at
Fulham during nearly the entire period of his active life.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Henry John Owen, M.A., succeeded his father in
1822.&nbsp; While at Park Chapel he was much esteemed by the
congregation, and when he left many deplored the loss of him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. John Harding, M.A., was appointed Minister of Park
Chapel in 1834.&nbsp; Some time after he became the Rector of St.
Ann&rsquo;s, Blackfriars.&nbsp; In both parishes he was much
beloved by his congregations, and greatly esteemed by the
parishioners.&nbsp; At length he was consecrated Bishop of
Bombay, and, having remained in India for many years, he returned
to England, and a short time since preached on a Sunday evening
at Park Chapel.&nbsp; An affecting scene took place on that
occasion, as his lordship left the chapel.&nbsp; A great number
of persons had assembled outside to shew the respect they
entertained towards him, notwithstanding his long absence from
Chelsea.&nbsp; When Bishop Harding approached, he seemed almost
overpowered with the kind recollection manifested by so many of
the congregation and other inhabitants, and, after a slight
pause, he said, with considerable emotion, &ldquo;My dear
friends, I thank you from my heart for your kind remembrance of
me.&nbsp; May God bless every one of you!&rdquo;&nbsp; It should
here be mentioned that Bishop Harding, previously to his ministry
at Park Chapel, had <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>been at St. Luke&rsquo;s New Parish Church, with the
late revered Rev. H. Blunt, M.A., father of the present respected
Rector, at which Church he was also greatly esteemed.</p>
<p>The Rev. Henry Vaughan, M.A., did not long remain at Park
Chapel, as the state of his health rendered it impossible for him
to continue.&nbsp; Some short time afterwards he was called to
his eternal rest.&nbsp; I heard it once stated that Christian
love was engraved on his forehead.</p>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Vores, M.A., who was next in succession, was,
like his predecessors, much beloved.&nbsp; About five years after
his appointment he vacated it, and went to Hastings.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Miller, the Rev. W. Cadman, M.A., and the Rev. C.
J. Goodhart, M.A., were equally respected as being zealous and
faithful ministers.&nbsp; The two former are, at the present
time, in the full vigour of life, and actively engaged in
discharging their sacred duties in large parishes.&nbsp; With
respect to Mr. Goodhart, who has only recently left the chapel,
and whose ministry there extended over so many years, it would be
a difficult task to notice him adequately in a given space; the
best summary will be to state that on his retirement he was
presented with a silver salver and a purse containing about
&pound;540, as a testimony of the high respect entertained by the
congregation for his long and faithful ministrations.</p>
<p>The Rev. J. G. Gregory, M.A., succeeded Mr. Goodhart at the
close of the year 1868.&nbsp; The body of the chapel, since his
appointment, has been entirely re-pewed, the old high pews having
been all removed, and the seats made more commodious by
additional width being given to them.&nbsp; Several other
alterations have been made, and a few more are said to be in
contemplation.&nbsp; The whole interior of the chapel is
therefore now greatly improved, both as regards comfort and
appearance.&nbsp; The exterior of the structure, however,
requires to be altogether rebuilt, as soon as practicable, so as
to accord with the ecclesiastical architecture of the present
day, especially in such a locality as West Brompton and South
Kensington.&nbsp; In the Vestry Room are portraits of the
different Ministers of Park Chapel, commencing with the Rev. John
Owen, and terminating with the Rev. Mr. Goodhart, with only one
exception, the portrait of Mr. Vaughan, the absence of which may
be attributed to the short period of his ministry, in consequence
of his illness and death, and the difficulty afterwards of
procuring a correct likeness of him.&nbsp; It would be well if
this memorial portrait could be added to the others.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Their
Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Sussex attended this
chapel in 1812, when a collection was made for the benefit of the
schools, on which occasion a guard of honour, selected from Queen
Charlotte&rsquo;s Royal Volunteers, was stationed at the doors on
their arrival and departure.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Adjoining the chapel a building was erected, in 1828, by
subscription, and the profits of a sale of fancy work, for the
reception of the children of Park Chapel Schools, &amp;c.&nbsp;
The whole charge originally was &pound;900.&nbsp; Several
alterations, however, have since been made in the arrangement of
this building.&nbsp; The Girls&rsquo; Day and Sunday Schools, and
the Infant School, are now only held in it, besides a few
occasional meetings in connection with the numerous benevolent
societies supported by the liberal contributions of the
congregation.&nbsp; The boys&rsquo; school was transferred to the
Clock House some years since.&nbsp; This latter school owes its
origin to Samuel Gower Poole, Esq., who once resided in Dudmaston
House, King&rsquo;s Road, and to whom reference has already been
made.&nbsp; The annual meetings. &amp;c., are also held in the
Clock House schoolroom.</p>
<h3>CHELSEA PARK.</h3>
<p>This was part of the property of Sir Thomas More, and is
called, in old deeds, the &ldquo;Sand Hills;&rdquo; was
originally open fields, with a footpath across to Little
Chelsea.&nbsp; The whole was enclosed with a brick wall, in 1625,
by the Lord Treasurer, Cranfield, and converted into a park,
which name it has retained ever since, but the walls have
gradually given way to the erection of buildings.&nbsp; The park
originally consisted of 32 acres, situated north of the
King&rsquo;s Road, between Park and Upper Church Street. <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1721 a patent was obtained for a manufactory of raw silk,
and this park was taken for the purpose, and planted with
mulberry trees.&nbsp; It attracted a considerable share of public
<a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>attention
at the time, but proved unsuccessful.&nbsp; The premises of the
Raw Silk Company were rated in the parish books at
&pound;200.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In Walpole&rsquo;s Catalogue of Engravers, it is stated that
James Christopher le Blon, in 1734, set up a project for copying
the cartoons in tapestry, and made some fine drawings for the
purpose.&nbsp; Houses were built, and looms erected, on the above
mulberry ground, but either the expense was too great, or the
contributions did not arrive fast enough.&nbsp; The bubble burst,
several suffered, and Le Blon was heard of no more.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Interesting Particulars of Sir Henry and
Lady Wilson</span>.&nbsp; On the northern border of the old park,
just described, is a capital mansion in which Sir Henry Wright
Wilson resided for many years, the entrance to it being in the
Fulham Road, and which is still designated as Chelsea Park.&nbsp;
The pleasure grounds attached to it were some years since much
more extensive than they are at present.&nbsp; Sir Henry married
a daughter of the Earl of Aylesbury, who was left a valuable
estate in Hampshire, said to be worth about &pound;3000 a year,
under the most singular circumstances.&nbsp; Lady Frances Wilson
was informed in the year 1824, while at breakfast, that an
eccentric person named Wright, who had died a few days previously
at an obscure lodging in Pimlico, had appointed her and Mr. C.
Abbot his executors, and after some legacies had bequeathed to
Lady Frances the residue of his property by a will dated as far
back as 1800.&nbsp; As Lady Frances declared herself unacquainted
with the name of the testator, she at first concluded that there
was some mistake.&nbsp; After further explanation, the person of
Mr. Wright was described to her, and Lady Frances recollected
that the description answered that of a gentleman she had
remembered as a constant frequenter at the Opera many years
previously.&nbsp; To satisfy herself of the identity she went to
Mr. Wright&rsquo;s late lodgings, and saw him in his coffin, when
she recognised the features as those of the person whose eyes had
so often persecuted her when she was Lady Frances Bruce, but who
had never spoken to her, and of whom she had no knowledge
whatever. <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a>&nbsp; Lady Francis was never considered
by her friends to be beautiful, and the general opinion at the
time was that <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>the legacy was intended for a lady who occupied a box
next to that in which Lady Frances sat when at the Opera.&nbsp;
Sir Henry was in Parliament when the above estate came into his
wife&rsquo;s possession, but he afterwards had to contest his
seat, and lost it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir Henry Wright Wilson and the Poor
Carpenter</span>.&mdash;The following anecdote will no doubt
amuse many readers.&nbsp; Sir Henry&rsquo;s establishment was
large, and he had been accustomed to employ at times a jobbing
carpenter, who had at one period been in better
circumstances.&nbsp; This person had received specific
instructions to do certain work, which required a little trifling
assistance, such as to help him to remove something which stood
in the way, and which the carpenter could not possibly do without
temporary aid.&nbsp; He asked several of the grooms and others to
assist, but they all made frivolous excuses, and consequently the
work was not done by the appointed time.&nbsp; When Sir Henry
returned home he noticed that his orders had been neglected, and,
on ascertaining the particulars, without making any remarks, he
quietly entered the house.&nbsp; The next morning, however, he
gave instructions for his carriage with four horses to be
immediately got ready.&nbsp; He then sent for the carpenter, and
after a short time the carriage was at the entrance door, when,
to the great surprise of the servants, he desired him to take a
seat in it.&nbsp; Sir Henry then mounted his horse, and,
notwithstanding the dirty state of the roads, took them through
Fulham, over Putney Bridge, round by Wandsworth and Battersea,
back to Chelsea.&nbsp; On their return he insisted that the
horses and carriage should be immediately cleaned, or else to be
dismissed from his service.&nbsp; Sir Henry being esteemed a good
master they preferred obedience, and it was said that although
the carpenter was afterwards subject to an occasional jeer, he
never had again to complain of their conduct towards him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Elm</span>.&mdash;This is
situated at the top of Upper Church Street, but the spot for some
time past seems to be merged into the Fulham Road, and is either
so called, or else it is described as being near to it.&nbsp; The
original name, Queen&rsquo;s Elm, which it is to be hoped will
still be retained, is said traditionally to have derived its
origin from the following circumstance.&nbsp; Queen Elizabeth was
walking out with the great Lord Burleigh, and being overtaken
with a heavy shower of rain, took shelter under an elm tree
growing on this spot.&nbsp; After the shower was over, she said,
&ldquo;Let this henceforth be called the Queen&rsquo;s
Tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>This tradition is remarkably confirmed, as will be seen
by the following extract:&mdash;&ldquo;It appears by the Church
Book, beginning 1586, and in the 28th Elizabeth, that the tree at
the end of the Duke&rsquo;s Walk is in Chelsea parish called the
Queen&rsquo;s Tree; and that there was an arbour built round it
by one Bostocke, at the charge of the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>The Jews&rsquo; Burial Ground, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>The Jews&rsquo; Burial Ground is at Queen&rsquo;s Elm, and was
erected in 1816 by the individuals whose names are inscribed on
the wall of the entrance building, and to their
descendants.&nbsp; There is also inscribed the 16th Psalm in
Hebrew.&nbsp; The lower part of the building is called the hall,
the upper part is intended for the keeper.&nbsp; Unlike the
arrangement in the Moravians&rsquo; Burial Ground, the graves are
in rows, without any distinction as to sex.&nbsp; At burials the
mourners do not approach the grave, but stand at a distance, so
that they may hear sufficiently to join in the prayers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. J. B. Owen, M.A., Vicar of St. Jude&rsquo;s Church,
Chelsea, in an admirable lecture delivered by him in 1862, in the
Vestry Hall, King&rsquo;s Road, related the following
anecdote:&mdash;&ldquo;An Hebrew friend amused and puzzled me
with a sentiment he had once given at a festival of one of the
London Guilds.&nbsp; Being pressed for a toast, he gave
&lsquo;The Queen of the Jews, and of no other
nation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many conjectures were hazarded, as wide of
the mark as Jezebel and the Queen of Sheba.&nbsp; The company
confessed themselves beaten, and at last my friend gave the
answer&mdash;&lsquo;Queen Victoria.&rsquo;&nbsp; But this only
darkened the enigma more than ever.&nbsp; After some time, he
said, J. (or I.) E. W. S. makes Ireland, England, Wales, and
Scotland, and J. E. W. S. spells Jews, and makes Victoria
&lsquo;Queen of the Jews, and of no other
nation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;England,&rdquo; said Mr. Owen, &ldquo;owes a great
national debt of amends to their Hebrew brethren.&nbsp; For
several centuries they were bought and sold as chattels,
plundered and exiled, as if they were outlaws.&nbsp; In the
sixteenth year of Edward I. all the <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Jews in England were imprisoned, and
though they redeemed themselves for a vast sum, three years
after, the fraudulent tyrant banished them all; and they remained
in banishment 364 years, till the rough justice of old Oliver
Cromwell restored them to their trade and worship.&nbsp; The
proverb &lsquo;worth a Jew&rsquo;s eye&rsquo; alludes to the
barbarities practiced on the Jews, whose money was commonly
extorted from them by drawing their teeth, or putting out their
eyes.&nbsp; There are no judgments in Scripture more terrible
than those denounced against the oppressors of Judah.&nbsp; We
may be thankful that we have lived to witness the last vestige of
injustice to our Hebrew fellow-citizens erased from our
statutes.&nbsp; Have we also honestly received the social and
religious interests of the Jews into the unreserved sympathy of
Christian hearts?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Francis Hargrave, Esq., a barrister, resided in York Place,
(the houses of which are now nearly all converted into shops, and
which is situated near to the Jews&rsquo; Burial Ground), for a
considerable period.&nbsp; He particularly distinguished himself
in the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> case of James Somerset, a negro, for
whom he was counsel, and his argument was the occasion of a
precedent being established for the freedom of slaves the moment
they set foot on English land.&nbsp; He possessed a very
extensive and most valuable library, which Parliament purchased
for &pound;8000, in order that it might be placed in the British
Museum.&nbsp; He died here in 1821, aged 80.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sydenham Edwards, Esq., F.L.S., an eminent botanical
draughtsman, lived in Charles Street, Queen&rsquo;s Elm, and
afterwards removed to Barrossa Place, where he died in
1819.&nbsp; The Flora Londinensis, Rees&rsquo;
Encyclop&aelig;dia, &amp;c., were greatly indebted to his
masterly pencil.</p>
<h3>CHURCH STREET.</h3>
<p>Alexander Stephens, Esq., built and resided in Park House,
Upper Church Street, for a great many years.&nbsp; He was the
author of several popular works, was born at Elgin, about 1757,
and completed his education at the University of Aberdeen, which
he left at the early age of 18 years, for the purpose of <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>proceeding to
the West India Islands, principally with a view to add to his
stock of useful information and knowledge of the world.&nbsp; Mr.
Stephens purchased a Commission in the 84th regiment, but never
joined in consequence of the sudden reduction of that
corps.&nbsp; At the age of 21, he entered himself a member of the
Middle Temple, where he continued his vigorous pursuit of legal
studies for several years.&nbsp; His earliest production was
&ldquo;Jamaica,&rdquo; a descriptive poem; and his next,
published within a few years afterwards, &ldquo;The
Temple,&rdquo; a kind of law journal.&nbsp; But of his printed
works, undoubtedly, the most approved are the volumes of the
&ldquo;Public Characters;&rdquo; also a &ldquo;Life of John Horne
Took,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;History of the Wars, which arose out
of the French Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The industry of Mr. Stephens in the collection of the
materials for his biographical works has not often been
surpassed.&nbsp; He was accustomed to commit to paper the most
trifling memoranda illustrative of the history of any eminent
individual the moment they were communicated to him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Stephens enjoyed the confidential friendship of the late
Duke of Kent, and was in habits of unreserved intimacy with many
other distinguished characters of the age.&nbsp; He was related
to the Duke of Roxburgh, whose claim to that title he pleaded
with memorable success in the House of Lords.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Although generally of retired habits, Mr. Stephens often felt
interested in the parochial concerns of Chelsea, and
distinguished himself by the manliness and zeal with which he
supported measures which to him appeared likely to prove
beneficial.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Stephens wrote much and well for the periodical
press.&nbsp; The pages of the Analytical Review abound in
important articles from his pen.&nbsp; To the Monthly Magazine,
also, he was a frequent contributor.&nbsp; Besides the
composition of papers on the Belles Lettres, he was in the habit
of furnishing biographical notices for that journal.&nbsp; In
extent of information touching the lives and actions of the
cotemporary generation, he was equalled by few writers of his
age.&nbsp; Mr. Stephens&rsquo;s sound constitution was gradually
impaired by intense study, added to the immoderate use of
coldiam, on the efficacy of which he placed implicit
reliance.&nbsp; For the last two years of his life he suffered
severely from the gout, and at last died somewhat suddenly at his
house in Upper Church Street, in 1821, aged 64, and was interred
in the burial ground attached to St. Luke&rsquo;s Church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>A. H.
Haworth, Esq., occupied a house in Upper Church Street in 1825,
and for some time previous to that year.&nbsp; He possessed an
unrivalled Museum of Entomology and Natural History, the
collection of 40 years laborious research.&nbsp; It would be
impossible here to give any thing like an adequate notice of what
it contained.&nbsp; There were about 40,000 insects, arranged in
systematic order, and about 20,000 dried plants, arranged in
natural order, and glued.&nbsp; His contributions to the
Linn&aelig;an Society and Horticultural Society, Philosophical
Magazine, &amp;c., were greatly esteemed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I. N. Sartorius, Esq., so long celebrated for his faithful
delineations of animal life, resided in this street in 1830, and
for some years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Philip Reinagle, Esq., R.A., celebrated for his beautiful
specimens of landscape paintings, and whose family were eminent
for their proficiency in the fine arts, resided also here about
the same period.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>W. H. Davis, Esq., at a much later period, resided also for
many years in Upper Church Street, near the King&rsquo;s Road; he
was considered to be one of the best animal portrait painters,
and was constantly employed every Smithfield Cattle Show, his
works being very highly prized.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Crossing the King&rsquo;s Road, we enter into that portion of
Church Street which leads direct to the Old Church.&nbsp; This
ancient thoroughfare was built upon at a very early period, and
many eminent persons have resided here at various times; but
principally since the Rectory was removed hither, in 1569, from
Milman&rsquo;s Row.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>William Tebbs, Esq., Proctor, resided nearly opposite the
Rectory House, in Church Street, for many years; he was highly
respected professionally, and much esteemed for his kindness and
liberality to the poor.&nbsp; Mr. Tebbs, sen., dwelt here in
1819, and his name appears subsequently and previously for a long
time as a contributor to most of the local charities.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry Virtue Tebbs, Esq., son of the preceding, and who was in
partnership with his father, resided in a commodious detached
house, with large enclosed garden, in Cooks&rsquo; Ground, for a
long time.&nbsp; Like the rest of his family he was greatly
respected by the inhabitants, and ever ready to promote every <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>good work in
the parish.&nbsp; Of him it may truly be said that he was the
constant friend of the needy and helpless.&nbsp; He was a zealous
supporter of the Chelsea Auxiliary Bible Society, and he devoted
most of his leisure hours in promoting the various societies
connected with Park Chapel, especially the Day and Sunday
Schools.&nbsp; Some few years since he removed from the parish to
the deep regret of a numerous circle of friends, whose sincere
hope is that his benevolent heart may still beat for many a year
to come.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One of the most ancient mansions (pulled down some few years
ago) was called Church Place.&nbsp; It was said to have been the
residence of various eminent persons; and some have confidently
asserted that it was the palace of the Earl of Essex.&nbsp; It
was also said to have been used by Queen Anne as a laundry.&nbsp;
In the back front there was a date, cut in brick,
&ldquo;1641.&rdquo;&nbsp; This old house is first mentioned in
the parish books in 1696; it is also mentioned repeatedly in the
Inquests of Court Leet, and Court Baron, before and after that
period.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Atterbury resided facing the river, near the Old Church,
in 1695, as appears by the parish books, and afterwards in Church
Street, for several years; one of his letters is dated from hence
in 1698.&nbsp; There he became acquainted with Swift, in 1711, to
whom he was before unknown.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Francis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, was born in 1662, and
was educated in Westminster School, and afterwards was elected a
Student of Christ Church, Oxford, where he soon distinguished
himself by his wit and learning, and gave early proofs of his
poetical talents.&nbsp; In 1687, he made his first essay in
controversial writing, and shewed himself an able and strenuous
advocate for the Protestant religion.&nbsp; In 1691 he took holy
orders, and was elected in the same year Lecturer of St.
Bride&rsquo;s, London, and Preacher of Bridewell Chapel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Upon the accession of Queen Anne, in 1702, Dr. Atterbury was
appointed one of her Majesty&rsquo;s Chaplains in Ordinary; and
in 1704 was advanced to the Deanery of Carlisle.&nbsp; In 1713,
at the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Harcourt, the Queen
promoted him to the Bishopric of Rochester.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1722, Dr. Atterbury, on suspicion of being concerned in a
plot in favour of the Pretender, was apprehended and committed to
the Tower.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards he was condemned to <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>perpetual
exile.&nbsp; Just before this, a large fine dropped to him as
Dean of Westminster, but he could have no right to receive it
without the seal being set to it in full chapter.&nbsp; Sir
Robert Walpole earnestly enquired whether a Chapter could not be
held in the Tower, that he might receive the benefit of the
fine.&nbsp; A chapter was accordingly there held, and the Bishop
received a &pound;1000 for his share.&nbsp; This anecdote, which
is well authenticated, does great credit to the liberality of
Walpole.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Atterbury, in his private character, was most amiable and
exemplary; as a preacher he was eloquent, and as a writer, his
sermons, letters and other tracts, proved most decidedly that he
possessed piety, genius, and erudition.&nbsp; On the 18th of
June, 1723, having the day before taken leave of his friends,
this eminent prelate embarked on board the Aldborough man-of-war,
and landed on the Friday following at Calais.</p>
<blockquote><p>A prelate for wit, and for eloquence
fam&rsquo;d,<br />
Apollo soon miss&rsquo;d, and he need not be nam&rsquo;d;<br />
Since amidst a whole bench, of which some are so bright,<br />
No one of them shines so learn&rsquo;d and
polite.&mdash;<i>Sheffield</i>, 1719.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The celebrated Dean Swift came to Chelsea in the year 1711,
and took up his residence facing Dr. Atterbury&rsquo;s house in
Church Street.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Jonathan Swift, Dean of St. Patrick, in Dublin, an
illustrious poet, and political and satirical writer, was born in
Dublin in 1667, and died in 1745.&nbsp; Of a life so various and
so full of business as Swift&rsquo;s, we know not what part we
could select consistent with the limits of this work that would
not excite rather than gratify curiosity.</p>
<p>The company of Swift was courted by persons of the first rank
in life and literature; the following peculiarities may be
related:&mdash;He made to himself a rule never to speak more than
a minute at a time, and to wait for others to take up the
conversation.&nbsp; He was singularly happy in punning; and used
to say, that none despised that talent but those who were without
it.&nbsp; He also greatly excelled in telling a story; but, in
the latter part of his life, used to tell the same rather to
often.&nbsp; Though to strangers he appeared churlish, and
austere to his servants, it is said he was a kind and generous
master; he was also very charitable to the poor.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Swift
has been very minute and circumstantial in describing the
particulars relative to his residence here, and his acquaintance
with Dr. Atterbury.&nbsp; I will select one instance of
it:&mdash;&ldquo;I got here,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;with Patrick
and my portmanteau for sixpence, and pay six shillings a week for
one silly room, with confounded coarse sheets.&nbsp; I lodge just
over against Dr. Atterbury&rsquo;s house; and yet, perhaps, I
shall not like the place the better for that.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Thomas Shadwell, Esq., Poet Laureat, another resident of
Church Street, was born at Stanton Hall, Norfolk, and received
his education at Bury School, and Caius College, Cambridge.&nbsp;
His father, who held a place of profit and distinction in the law
in Ireland, bestowed the learning and exercises of a gentleman
upon him.&nbsp; Notwithstanding that, Lord Rochester has
said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;None seem to touch true Comedy<br />
But hasty Shadwell and slow Wycherlye,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yet that lord had a better opinion of his conversation than
his writings when he said &ldquo;that if Shadwell had burned all
he wrote, and printed all he spoke, he would have shewn more wit
and humour than any other poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the reign of
William III. he succeeded Dryden, as Poet Laureat, under whose
lash he had previously fallen.&nbsp; His works, consisting of
seventeen plays, were published in three volumes 12mo. in 1720,
with a short account of his life written by his son, Sir John
Shadwell, Knight, who was physician to Queen Anne, and resided in
a house at Chelsea, which had been previously occupied by Dr.
Arbuthnot.&nbsp; Shadwell died at Chelsea in 1692, aged 52, and
was buried in the Church, November 24, when a funeral sermon was
preached by his friend Dr. Nicholas Brady, in which he assures us
that &ldquo;his natural and acquired abilities made him
sufficiently remarkable to all that he conversed with, very few
being equal to him in all the becoming qualities and
accomplishments of a gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; His widow, who had
been an actress, survived him, and resided at Chelsea some
years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. John Arbuthnot, a native of Scotland, had his education in
the University of Aberdeen, where he took the degree of Doctor of
Physic.&nbsp; He came to London about the year 1695, and at first
taught the mathematics for his support.&nbsp; His facetious and
agreeable conversation introduced him by degrees into practice;
and he became eminent in his profession.&nbsp; Being at Epsom
when Prince George of Denmark was suddenly taken <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>ill, he was
called in to his assistance; his advice was successful, and his
Highness recovering, employed him ever afterwards as his
physician.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s death, and the disasters which fell upon his
friends on that occasion, deeply affected his health and spirits;
and, to divert his melancholy, he paid a visit to his brother, a
banker, at Paris.&nbsp; He returned to London, and continued his
medical profession with great reputation, employing his leisure
hours in writing papers of wit and humour.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About this time Dr. Arbuthnot took a house in Church Street,
where he at times entertained a select number of his
friends.&nbsp; He died in 1735 in Cork Street, Burlington
Gardens.&nbsp; In his writings he has shewn himself equal to any
of his cotemporaries in humour, wit, and learning.&nbsp; Sir John
Shadwell, son of the Laureat, afterwards occupied the house.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Edward Chamberlayne, it appears from the land tax book of
this parish, anno 1704, resided next door to Dr. King, the
rector, in a house that is still standing, and which is a few
doors north of the White Horse public house, in Church
Street.&nbsp; He was descended from an ancient family, and born
at Odington, in Gloucestershire, in 1616.&nbsp; During the civil
war he made the tour of Europe.&nbsp; After the Restoration he
was chosen F.R.S.; and, in 1669, attended Charles, Earl of
Carlisle, as secretary to the embassy to Stockholm, with the
order of the Garter for the King of Sweden.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards the degree of LL.D. was conferred on him at Cambridge,
and also the same at Oxford at a later period.&nbsp; About the
year 1679, he received the appointment of tutor to the Duke of
Grafton, one of the natural sons of Charles II.; and subsequently
he instructed Prince George of Denmark, consort to Queen Anne, in
the English language.&nbsp; He died at his house in Church Street
in 1703, having been an active magistrate in this parish for many
years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Chamberlayne, (son of Dr. Chamberlayne,) who resided in
the house formerly occupied by his father, was a learned and
worthy man.&nbsp; He was admitted into Trinity College, Oxford,
in 1685, and was gentleman usher to George Prince of
Denmark.&nbsp; He translated, from the French and Spanish: 1. The
Manner of making Tea, Coffee, and Chocolate.&nbsp; 2. From
Italian into English, A Treasure of Health, written by Castor
Durant de Gualdo, physician of Rome.&nbsp; 3. The Arguments of
the Books and Chapters of the Old and New Testaments, with
Practical <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Observations, written originally in French by the Rev.
Mr. Ostervald, Professor of Divinity, and one of the members of
the church at Neufchatel, in Switzerland, and by him presented to
the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, of which society
he was a member.&nbsp; 4. The Lives of the Members of the Royal
Academy of Sciences; translated from the French of M. de
Fontenelle; republished since, in 1721, under the title of
&ldquo;Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris,
Epitomized, with the Lives of the late Members of that
Society.&rdquo;&nbsp; 5. The Religious or Christian Philosopher;
or, The right Use of Contemplating the Work of the Creator;
translated from the Dutch of Dr. Nieuwentyt, with cuts.&nbsp; 6.
History of the Reformation in and about the Low Countries;
translated from the Low Dutch of Gerard Brandt.&nbsp; 7. The
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, in 100 Languages.&nbsp; 8. Dissertations,
Historical, Theological, and Critical, on the most memorable
events of the Old and New Testaments, wherein the Spirit of the
Sacred Writings is shewn, their authority confirmed,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Mr. Chamberlayne was Fellow of the Royal Society,
to whom he communicated several papers on important
subjects.&nbsp; He augmented and improved his father&rsquo;s book
of &ldquo;The Present State of Great Britain,&rdquo; to the
latter editions of which his name is prefixed.&nbsp; He was not
only learned but pious, earnest at all times in promoting and
disseminating religious principles.&nbsp; In the old churchyard,
facing the river, are inscriptions to the memory of this
distinguished family. <a name="citation82"></a><a
href="#footnote82" class="citation">[82]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Bowack, to whom we are so much indebted for his valuable
information, resided near Dr. Chamberlayne&rsquo;s house in
Church Street.&nbsp; In 1705 he began to publish, in folio
numbers, &ldquo;The Antiquities of Middlesex; being a Collection
of the several Church Monuments in that County; also an
Historical Account of each Church and Parish, with the Seats,
Villages, and names of the most eminent Inhabitants.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The work extended through the parishes of Chelsea, Fulham,
Kensington, Chiswick, and Acton, and was then discontinued.&nbsp;
It is much to be regretted that he could not complete his
design.&nbsp; He has preserved many monumental inscriptions,
since destroyed.&nbsp; Mr. Bowack was writing master to
Westminster School.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; says Mr.
Faulkner, in reference to his own work, &ldquo;carefully embodied
the greater part of the information contained in his
(Bowack&rsquo;s) folio volume, now become extremely
scarce.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>John
Martyn, Esq., who resided in Church Street, next door to Dr.
Chamberlayne, was the son of a merchant of London.&nbsp; He was
born in 1699.&nbsp; With him it was a subject of frequent
exultation, in after-life, that Providence had thrown him into a
country, and produced him at a period so fertile in genius and
literary accomplishments.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was truly the golden
age of learning,&rdquo; says Mr. Faulkner, &ldquo;and to converse
with those heroes who adorn it was deemed no mean privilege, or
glory, by one who well knew how to value mental
wealth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was sent by his father to a private
school (his mother died when he was scarcely a twelvemonth old),
and here by his own industry rather than by any advantage of
instruction, he made a tolerable proficiency in school learning,
but was taken away from his beloved books to engage in the
business of a counting house.&nbsp; Most youths of his age, in
such an occupation, would have found their minds sufficiently
employed, but he, insatiate of knowledge, after the labours of
the day, dedicated most of those hours which are usually given to
bodily rest to the improvement of his understanding.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s propensity to the science of botany was
first excited by an acquaintance with Mr. Wilmer, an apothecary,
who afterwards became the reader in the Botanic Garden at
Chelsea, and by an intimacy contracted with Dr. Blair and Dr.
Sherard.&nbsp; In the year 1732, he published a translation of
&ldquo;Tournefort&rsquo;s History of Plants about Paris,&rdquo;
and in the same year a &ldquo;Catalogue of the Plants about
London,&rdquo; but he did not complete it.&nbsp; From a strong
conviction that observations made upon plants in their natural
places of growth were the least liable to error, he about the
same time began his botanical excursions, which were mostly
performed on foot, and were continued for a long period with
unwearied diligence.&nbsp; His &ldquo;Hortus Siccus,&rdquo;
containing 1,400 specimens, is a sufficient testimony of his
industry.&nbsp; Nor did he confine himself wholly to the
contemplation of vegetables, and their hidden virtues; the
numerous insect tribe began to attract no small share of his
attention.&nbsp; In 1721, he principally instituted the Botanical
Society, in London.&nbsp; Dr. Dillenius was president, and Mr.
Martyn was secretary.&nbsp; This society kept together till
1726.&nbsp; About this time he became a member of the Royal
Society, and now began to apply himself most seduously to the
practice of physic.&nbsp; For this purpose he was admitted of
Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and kept five terms, with an
intention to have proceeded regularly with his degrees, but from
peculiar circumstances he was prevented from finishing his
design.&nbsp; He <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>had now lived and practised physic in Great St.
Helen&rsquo;s, Bishopsgate Street, during three years; but,
finding the air of London disagree with his constitution, he
embraced a favourable opportunity which offered of removing to
Chelsea, where he practised physic with success and great
reputation for above twenty years.</p>
<p>In 1733, he was chosen Professor of Botany in the University
of Cambridge, where he had given several courses of lectures, and
had greatly restored the study of that science.</p>
<p>Mr. Martyn, in 1723 (as is stated in a preceding page),
married Eulalia, youngest daughter of the Rev. Dr. John King,
Rector of Chelsea, by whom he had three sons and five daughters,
all of whom were born in Church Street, Chelsea, in the same
house wherein their mother was born and died, and in which her
father, Dr. King, lived and died.&nbsp; Mrs. Martyn died in 1749,
from a cancer in her breast, occasioned by a violent blow given
her as she was walking in London.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1750, Mr. Martyn married, secondly, a daughter of Claude
Fonnereau, Esq., merchant of London, who bore him one son and
survived him.&nbsp; Soon after this he retired to Streatham,
Surrey.&nbsp; In 1761 he resigned his professorship of botany;
and some time after presented to the University his library of
botanical books, amounting to above 200 volumes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Chelsea, notwithstanding the happiness he enjoyed at
Streatham, seems after all to have been his favourite place of
abode, as he removed back again to his former residence in Church
Street, and at last, by the most gradual and gentle decay, died
there in 1768.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Martyn&rsquo;s benevolence was that of a Christian,
diffusive and unconfined; he was considered as the father of the
poor in the parish, and gave constant attention to the sick, both
in and out of the workhouse.&nbsp; He was the author of many
works, two of which we shall notice:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;An Account of an Aurora Australis,
seen at Chelsea, March 18, 1738&ndash;9.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
the first account which had ever been given of that
phenomenon.</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;An Account of an Earthquake felt in
London, February 8, 1749&ndash;50.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>The
following extract from the latter account will no doubt interest
the reader: &ldquo;At 40 minutes after noon, all the houses were
violently shaken, especially those nearest the river.&nbsp; A
maid servant, passing from one under office to another, felt the
ground, which was six feet below the surface, shake.&nbsp; Of
those who were in the street, or on the river, some felt, others
not.&nbsp; It was felt at Fulham, but not at Hounslow, Brentford,
nor Richmond, nor farther westward than Kensington Turnpike; it
seemed to terminate in the west, about two miles beyond
Chelsea.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Martyn was also engaged in a weekly paper, called
&ldquo;The Grub Street Journal,&rdquo; which had a large sale,
about the year 1736.&nbsp; It was one of the most curious of the
periodical papers of that period.&nbsp; In a fine vein of irony
it attacked the heroes of the Dunciad, and tells some secrets of
their obscure quarrels. <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; The papers he
contributed are distinguished by the signature
&ldquo;B.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>William Petyt, Esq., to whom we have already slightly
referred, in the account of his gift to the parish of the School
Room at the Old Church, resided in Church Street, and died there
in 1707, aged 71 years.&nbsp; Of his progress through life there
is no information, except that he enjoyed considerable reputation
as a writer on the laws and constitution of England, which are
preserved in the Inner Temple Library.&nbsp; There is a long
Latin epitaph to his memory in the Temple Church.&nbsp; It was
the year before his death that he built the schoolrooms and
vestry.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The White Horse Inn in Church Street, which was burnt down
some years since, and a new one substituted for it, was a very
ancient house, built in the style which prevailed in the reigns
of Henry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; The disposition of the
rooms, the ancient panelling, and the various grotesque ornaments
and carving, especially of human figures in the form of brackets,
were well worthy of inspection, and excited the attention of most
strangers who visited the house.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The old Parochial Guardian Society mostly held their meetings
at the old White Horse Inn.&nbsp; The principal room was large
and consequently well-adapted for such purposes; and when the
parishioners met in open vestry, the house being <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>opposite to
the Vestry Room where they assembled, it was particularly
convenient on such occasions for the accommodation of the
ratepayers generally.&nbsp; The above society comprised a great
many members, and acted in conjunction with a large number of the
resident gentry of the parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Justice Walk, which extends from Church Street to Lawrence
Street, took its name from a magistrate who lived in it.&nbsp; An
avenue of lime trees formerly adorned it, and, being kept in good
order, it was a very agreeable footway for passengers.&nbsp;
There is now in it a commodious Wesleyan Chapel, built in
1841.&nbsp; The exterior is plain and unpretending.&nbsp; The
interior is neat, comfortable, and well ventilated.&nbsp; Beneath
the chapel is a spacious school room, in which the Sunday School
is held.&nbsp; This school is very well attended.&nbsp; Through
the exertions of the members, and other friends, the interior of
the chapel has recently been painted, and rendered more
comfortable in many respects.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chelsea China Manufactory was situate at the corner of
Justice Walk, and occupied the houses to the upper end of
Lawrence Street.&nbsp; Several of the large old houses were used
as shew-rooms.&nbsp; It has been discontinued for nearly 90
years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The manufactory of Chelsea porcelain was set on foot and
carried on by a Mr. Spremont, a foreigner.&nbsp; The
establishment employed a great number of hands; but the original
proprietor having acquired a large fortune retired from the
concern, and his successors, wanting his enterprise and spirit,
did not so well succeed, and in a few years finally abandoned
it.&nbsp; Previous to the dissolution, the proprietors presented
a memorial respecting it to the Government, requesting protection
and assistance, in which they stated that &ldquo;the manufacture
in England has been carried on by great labour and a large
expense; it is in many respects to the full as good as the
Dresden; and the late Duke of Orleans told Colonel York that the
metal or earth had been tried in his furnace, and was found to be
the best made in Europe.&nbsp; It is now daily improving, and
already employs, at least, 100 hands, of which is a nursery of
thirty lads taken from the parishes and charity schools, and bred
to designing and painting: arts very much wanted here, and which
are of the greatest use in our silk and printed linen
manufactories.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Specimens of this porcelain have always been much
esteemed, and still retain a great value.&nbsp; At the sale of
the effects of Queen Charlotte, the articles in Chelsea china, of
which her Majesty had a large collection, brought very high
prices.&nbsp; Mr. Watkins, in his Life of Queen Charlotte, says,
&ldquo;I beheld with admiration a complete service of Chelsea
china, porcelain, rich and beautiful in fancy beyond
expression.&nbsp; I really never saw any Dresden porcelain near
so fine.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. A. Stephens, whom we have already noticed, was told by the
foreman of the Chelsea China Manufactory (then in the workhouse
of St. Luke&rsquo;s, Middlesex), that Dr. Johnson had conceived a
notion that he was capable of improving on the manufacture of
china.&nbsp; He even applied to the directors of the Chelsea
China Works, and was allowed to <i>bake</i> his compositions in
their ovens in Lawrence Street, Chelsea.&nbsp; He was accordingly
accustomed to go down with his housekeeper, about twice a week,
and stop the whole day, she carrying a basket of provisions with
her.&nbsp; The Doctor, who was not allowed to enter the
<i>mixing</i> room, had access to every other part of the
premises, and formed his composition in a particular apartment,
without being overlooked by any one.&nbsp; He had also free
access to the oven, and superintended the whole of the process;
but completely failed, both as to composition and baking, for his
materials always yielded to the intensity of the heat, while
those of the Company came out of the furnace perfect and
complete.&nbsp; Dr. Johnson retired in disgust, but not in
despair, for he afterwards gave a dissertation on this very
subject in his works; but the overseer assured Mr. Stephens, in
1814, that he was still ignorant of the nature of the
operation.&nbsp; He seemed to think that the Doctor imagined one
single substance was sufficient, while he, on the other hand,
asserted that he always used sixteen, and he must have had some
practice, as he had nearly lost his eye-sight by firing batches
of china, both at Chelsea and Derby, to which the manufacture was
afterwards carried.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Chelsea china, originally patronised by the Duke of
Cumberland, and afterwards by Sir R. Faulkner, was a long time in
such repute as to be sold by auction, and as a set was purchased
as soon as baked, dealers were surrounding the doors for that
purpose. <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"

88</span>LAWRENCE STREET, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>Lawrence Street derives its name, as previously intimated,
from its having been the site of the residence of the Lawrence
family for many years.&nbsp; On this spot stood the first old
Manor House, until Lord Sandys alienated the manor to Henry
VIII., when that king sold it to Sir Thomas Lawrence, and erected
another in Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The ancient family of Lawrence first came into England with
William the Conqueror, and settled at Ashton Hall, in the county
of Lancaster, where they resided for 300 years, and possessed an
immense property, which, in the year 1591, included 34 manors,
the rental of which amounted to &pound;6000 per annum.&nbsp; It
is uncertain when this family first came to Chelsea, but as the
Lawrence chapel in the Old Church is built in the style of
architecture which prevailed at the beginning of the fourteenth
century, they were probably settled here about that period, and
some time before they purchased the manor house.&nbsp; Some of
the family who were buried in the chapel have already been
mentioned.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The chief branches of this eminent family resided in Chelsea,
in London, and at Iver, Bucks.&nbsp; Sir John Lawrence, knight,
was Lord Mayor of London in 1665.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some &ldquo;Pious Contemplations,&rdquo; on the arms of the
Lawrence family, are written in the margin of their
pedigree.&nbsp; They are supposed to have been affixed to it in
1664, but the author is not known.&nbsp; The following are the
concluding lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The way to Heaven is not with roses
spread,<br />
But throng&rsquo;d with thorns, as was Thy sacred head;<br />
Our peace is hack&rsquo;d and hew&rsquo;d, our life&rsquo;s a
war,<br />
We, for our Cross, must many crosses bear&mdash;<br />
Or, a red sea our passage doth withstand,<br />
Or, fiery serpents, or, a barren sand,<br />
Ere we can reach the truly Holy Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christ&rsquo;s Cross the ladder is that leads to
bliss,<br />
Blest Jacob&rsquo;s vision was a type of this;<br />
Who climbs by other steps is at a loss&mdash;<br />
To Heaven the only ladder is the Cross.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Ann,
Duchess of Monmouth and Buccleugh, relict of James, Duke of
Monmouth, resided in the &ldquo;great house&rdquo; in Lawrence
Street about 1714, and from that time it was called Monmouth
House.&nbsp; The following item appears in the
Churchwardens&rsquo; accounts for the year 1716: &ldquo;Paid the
ringers, when the Princess (afterwards Queen Caroline) visited
the Duchess of Monmouth, six shillings.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Duchess
was, it is said, for her agreeable person, good sense, and
irreproachable character, one of the most amiable ladies about
the Court.&nbsp; During the first years of her marriage she seems
to have been as happy, and as much envied as any woman in the
kingdom; but this happiness was of short duration; she was
unfortunately supplanted in the Duke&rsquo;s affections by Lady
Harriet Wentworth, daughter of the Earl of Cleveland, whose
personal charms were superior to her own.&nbsp; Her Grace died in
1732, aged 90 years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Gay was for some time secretary to the Duchess, as stated
in Johnson&rsquo;s Life of Gay.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Smollett afterwards resided in the same house in Lawrence
Street.&nbsp; He came to Chelsea on account of the bad state of
health of his beloved daughter, who was at that time in a
consumption, under which she finally sank in the year 1763.&nbsp;
The house and premises were extensive, and well suited for the
residence of a person of rank.&nbsp; There are few men of real
genius who have written more voluminously than Dr.
Smollett.&nbsp; His entertaining novels are so well known that it
seems almost unnecessary to mention Roderick Random, the
Adventures of Peregrine Pickle, Ferdinand Count Fathom, and Sir
Launcelot Greaves, the Expedition of Humphry Clinker, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He was bred to the medical profession, and in the early part
of his life served as a surgeon in the navy.&nbsp; It is said
that before he took a house at Chelsea he attempted to settle as
a practitioner, at Bath, but was unsuccessful, chiefly because he
could not render himself agreeable to the ladies.&nbsp; This,
however, was a little extraordinary, for Smollett was as graceful
and handsome a man as any of the age; besides, there was a
certain dignity in his manner which could not fail to inspire
respect whenever he appeared.&nbsp; Abandoning physic altogether
as a profession, he fixed his residence at Chelsea, and turned
his thoughts entirely to writing.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Smollett&rsquo;s History of England has had a most
extensive sale.&nbsp; He is said to have received &pound;2000 for
writing it and the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>continuation.&nbsp; During the last years of his life he
was employed in abridging the Modern Universal History, great
part of which he had originally written himself.&nbsp; In the
year 1755 he set on foot the Critical Review, and continued the
principal manager of it till he went abroad for the first time,
in the year 1763.&nbsp; He had made some very severe remarks on a
pamphlet published by Admiral Knowles, who commenced a
prosecution against the printer; and, just as sentence was going
to be pronounced, he came into Court, and avowed himself the
author; upon which he was fined &pound;100, and condemned to
three months&rsquo; imprisonment in the King&rsquo;s Bench.&nbsp;
It is there he is said to have written the Adventures of Sir
Launcelot Greaves, in which he has described some remarkable
characters, then his fellow-prisoners.&nbsp; When Lord Bute was
called to the chief administration of affairs, he was prevailed
upon to write in defence of that nobleman&rsquo;s measures, in a
weekly paper called the Briton.&nbsp; This gave rise to the
well-known North Briton, wherein he was rather baffled.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Smollett&rsquo;s constitution being at last greatly impaired
by a sedentary life, and assiduous application to study, he went
abroad for his health in 1769.&nbsp; He wrote accounts of his
travels, in a series of letters to his friends, which were
afterwards published.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>During that time he appears to have been occasionally in a
distressed state of mind.&nbsp; In his first letter he
writes:&mdash;&ldquo;In gratifying your curiosity, I shall find
some amusement to beguile the tedious hours; which, without some
such employment, would be rendered insupportable by distemper and
disquiet.&nbsp; You knew and pitied my situation: traduced by
malice, persecuted by faction, abandoned by false patrons, and
overwhelmed by domestic affliction.&rdquo;&nbsp; He here alludes
to the loss of his only daughter.&nbsp; In another letter,
addressed to Mr. Reid, of this parish, he desires to be
remembered to his Chelsea friends, wishing them that health and
happiness to which he himself was a stranger, and adds, &ldquo;I
am very glad to know your concert was so brilliant, and I hope
all your Chelsea societies will continue to flourish.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Smollett returned to England, but afterwards went back to
Italy, where he died in 1771.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The old Chelsea Stage Coaches started from Lawrence Street and
Church Street, between which places there were extensive
stabling, and a residence for the proprietor in the centre of the
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>yard.&nbsp; The fare for inside passengers was
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, outside 1<i>s.</i>, and no intermediate
fare at a lower sum was taken.&nbsp; Thanks to the General
Omnibus Company, to the Steamboat, and the Railway Companies, we
can now go to almost the extremity of London for 6<i>d.</i> and a
shorter distance for 3<i>d.</i></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lordship Place takes its name from having been the site of the
barns, &amp;c., of the Lord of the Manor.&nbsp; It is a short
street, near the river, connecting Lawrence Street with Cheyne
Row.&nbsp; In the early Parish Registers occur many lamentable
details of poor people being found dead in these barns, where
they had taken refuge from the inclemency of the weather.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Cheyne Row was built in 1708, and was named after the Lord of
the Manor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Denver, Esq., resided in Cheyne Row for the last twenty
years of his life.&nbsp; He devoted his time to study, and the
forming of a collection of early printed Bibles, manuscripts, and
missals, which was at last one of the most valuable in
England.&nbsp; His daughter, Miss Denyer, was very clever in
painting and illuminating on vellum, &amp;c.&nbsp; Her drawings
and miniatures were equal to the finest specimens of the middle
ages.&nbsp; Mr. Denyer died at the age of 71, and was buried in
the Old Church, and his affectionate daughter was also interred
near her father and mother.&nbsp; This family was distinguished
for their benevolence to the poor.</p>
<p>In Cheyne Row, within my recollection, many old and
influential families have resided there, who were greatly
respected.&nbsp; Amongst them may be mentioned Edmund Chalmers,
Esq., Thomas Chalmers, Esq., John Hulme, Esq., Edward Holl, Esq.,
the benevolent Mrs. Hebert, Richard Draper, Esq., George Blyth,
Esq., and Isaac Wrentmore, Esq.</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle, Esq., who is so well-known in literary and
other distinguished circles, and who is certainly one of the most
profound writers of the present age, has resided in Cheyne Row
for a great many years.&nbsp; The University of Edinburgh, last
year, conferred on him the highest honour it could bestow.&nbsp;
His habits of life at Chelsea are naturally secluded, but he is
nevertheless greatly respected by those who have an opportunity
of acquiring a knowledge of his social worth.&nbsp; Mr. Carlyle
begins now to bend with age, although apparently in tolerable
health, and, notwithstanding his recent severe bereavement, not a
cloud seems to dim the vigour of his intellectual faculties.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>In
Upper Cheyne Row there was formerly a manufactory for melting
gold and silver in crucibles, which was said to produce the best
articles of the kind in England.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Cook&rsquo;s Grounds was formerly a back way to Alston House,
Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Cook&rsquo;s Ground Chapel was originally built for the use of
the French Protestants, who had taken refuge in this country
after the revocation of the edict of Nantes, in the year
1685.&nbsp; Several French gardeners settled upon this spot, and
the Rev. Dr. King, the rector, mentions them in terms of great
kindness, and strongly recommends them to the protection of his
successors.&nbsp; The chapel was for many years in the
Independent Connexion.&nbsp; The Rev. Benjamin Fielder, in 1773,
succeeded the Rev. Mr. Trail, and died in 1803.&nbsp; His death
was very affecting; he had seated himself in the pulpit, and,
after a hymn had been sung, he was observed with his head
reclining, and without any signs of life.&nbsp; He was
immediately removed, but never spoke afterwards.&nbsp; The Rev.
John Bunce, who was well known and respected in Chelsea, was
minister at this chapel for many years, and subsequently Dr.
Tracey, Mr. Webb, and at the present time Mr. Hayward.</p>
<h3>Alston House, Cheyne Walk.</h3>
<p>Shrewsbury, or Alston House, a capital mansion, built about
the latter end of the reign of Henry VIII., was situated in
Cheyne Walk, to the west of the present &ldquo;Pier
Hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp; This house was considered for a long time to
have been the residence of Sir Thomas More; but Dr. King has
proved, from the most authentic documents, that it never had any
just pretensions to that honour.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was an irregular brick building, forming three sides of a
quadrangle.&nbsp; The principal room was one hundred and twenty
feet in length, and was originally wainscotted with carved
oak.&nbsp; One of the rooms was painted in imitation of marble,
and appeared to have been originally an oratory.&nbsp; Certain
curious <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>portraits on panel, which had ornamented the large
rooms, were destroyed some few years since; this is to be
regretted, as, in all probability, they represented its former
owners, or, at least, some persons of note.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Leading from the premises, towards the King&rsquo;s Road,
there is a subterranean passage, which has been explored for a
short distance.&nbsp; It is said, traditionally, to have
communicated with a cave or dungeon, situated at a considerable
distance from the house; but for what purpose made, no one now in
its vicinity confidently presumes to guess.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following information concerning this subterranean
passage, is obtained from a letter of Miss Gulston to Miss Tate,
who was the proprietor of the estate:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have found an old man, now living at
Chelsea, who worked at the paper manufactory when a lad, and who
has established the facts.&nbsp; I have always been laughed at
when I have mentioned the story.&nbsp; I have gotten two drawings
of the room and passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance to this passage was from the room used by
the paper stainers as a drying place.&nbsp; It had no fire-place
in it; the dimensions were nearly as follows: 25 feet high, 50
long, 36 wide; the ceiling was strong with beams, to sustain the
upper floors, but without any plastered ceiling.&nbsp; You
descended into it by a wide winding staircase, through a
circular-top door, strongly fortified with rivets and four large
hinges: this door was so contrived, that it opened far enough
back to hide the approach to the hole, and could there be
fastened so as to have the appearance of belonging to the large
room, and the circular steps leading to it caused the more
deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The side walls are all brick.&nbsp; This man never
could proceed with his light more than a distance of thirty
yards, when the light invariably went out.&nbsp; The passage is
free from any incumbrance of earth, or from any part of the side
walls having given way; as far as could be ascertained, its
direction was towards the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is regularly paved with two flag stones, leaving a
border of six inches of earth; width 3 feet, length 5&frac12;
feet.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;This passage was discovered, owing to the
proprietor having been robbed of a quantity of paper for
years.&nbsp; The man now alive volunteered to detect the thief;
the paper was found on the staircase descending to the
passage.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;E. <span

</blockquote>
<p>Alston House was for many years the residence of the
Shrewsbury family.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George, Earl of Shrewsbury, succeeded his father in the title,
June 28th, the 13th Edward IV., while a minor.&nbsp; In the reign
of Henry VIII. he was in high favour with that monarch, was
steward of the household, and a privy counsellor, and accompanied
the King at his interview with Francis I. at Guisnes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 28 Henry VIII., on the rebellion in the North, called
&ldquo;the pilgrimage of grace,&rdquo; occasioned by the
dissolution of the lesser monasteries, he was constituted the
King&rsquo;s Lieutenant, to march thither with a powerful army,
he himself having raised a number of men at his own expense, when
the Earl, and the Duke of Norfolk, succeeded in bringing the
rebels to submission, and obtained for them the King&rsquo;s
pardon.&nbsp; This nobleman resided occasionally at Chelsea; and
here his sixth son, by his first wife, was born.&nbsp; The Earl
died 1538; he is characterised by Polydore Virgil, &ldquo;as a
person noble, prudent, and moderate through the whole course of
his life.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Francis, his son and heir, is mentioned among the freeholders
in the court rolls of the Manor of Chelsea, 35 Henry VIII.&nbsp;
This nobleman also enjoyed the favour of his sovereign during
three succeeding reigns.&nbsp; In 1545 he was appointed the
King&rsquo;s Lieutenant in the North; and in the following year
was installed one of the Knights Companions of the most noble
order of the Garter.&nbsp; In 2 Edward VI. he had the command of
a large army that was sent into Scotland, and in 1st of Queen
Mary was made President of the Council of the North.&nbsp; He
died September 21, 1560.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George, Earl of Shrewsbury, son of the preceding, was
installed a Knight of the Garter, May 17, 1562.&nbsp; In 1568 the
custody of the Queen of Scots was committed to his charge.&nbsp;
In 1573, he presided as Lord High Steward at the trial of the
Duke of Norfolk; and on the death of his Grace, which <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>happened soon
after, he was constituted Earl Marshal of England.&nbsp; He died
1590, and was buried at Sheffield, in the county of York.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An inquisition, taken at Derby, 3rd April, 33 Elizabeth,
on the death of George, Earl of Shrewsbury; after reciting lands,
&amp;c., in many counties, adds Middlesex, one capital messuage,
&amp;c., in Chelsea.&nbsp; The value is lumped in many manors,
into a gross sum of &pound;800 a year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
inscription on his monument, among other things, sets forth,
&ldquo;That, as he excelled in mind, so was he skilled in the
affairs of war.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the arrival of Mary, Queen of
Scots, in England, she was again put under his care, and so
continued till 1584.&nbsp; His behaviour to her was ever generous
and honourable, sparing no cost for her entertainment.&nbsp;
Words cannot fully express the care and concern he had for her,
nor can envy itself say otherwise than he was a faithful and
prudent person; in a word, his integrity in his high office was
not to be suspected, although evil disposed persons secretly and
vaguely gave out that he had used too much familiarity with his
royal prisoner.&nbsp; Thus, noble by descent, he was more noble
and illustrious in his actions; famous at home and abroad; loyal
to his prince and true to his country; and he resigned his soul
in &ldquo;a good old age.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl married to his
second wife, Elizabeth, widow of Sir William St. Loo, Captain of
the Guards to Queen Elizabeth, who survived him, and to whom he
probably bequeathed his house at Chelsea, as it appears to have
descended to her son William, first Earl of Devonshire.&nbsp; In
&ldquo;Lodge&rsquo;s Illustrations of English History,&rdquo; is
a letter of this nobleman, dated from Chelsea, in 1585.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Elizabeth, Countess of Shrewsbury.&nbsp; This lady, who was
much celebrated for her beauty and accomplishments, and still
more for her extraordinary fortune in the world, was daughter of
John Hardwick, Esq., of the county of Derby.&nbsp; At the age of
fourteen she was married to Robert Barley, Esq., who, in about
two years, left her a very rich widow.&nbsp; The next husband was
Sir William Cavendish, ancestor of the Duke of Devonshire.&nbsp;
Her third was Sir William St. Loo.&nbsp; In this third widowhood
she had not survived her charms of wit and beauty, by which she
captivated the then greatest subject of the land, George, Earl of
Shrewsbury, whom she brought to terms of considerable honour and
advantage to herself and children; for he not only yielded to a
very large jointure, but to a union of families, by marrying
Mary, her youngest daughter, to Gilbert, his son and afterwards
his heir, and giving the Lady Grace, his youngest daughter, to
Henry, her eldest son.&nbsp; In 1590 she was a fourth <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>time left,
and continued a widow till her death.&nbsp; Her&rsquo;s was a
change of conditions that, perhaps, never fell to any one woman
before or since: to be four times a creditable and happy wife,
and to rise by every husband to greater wealth and higher
honours; and, after all, to live seventeen years a widow in
absolute power and plenty.&nbsp; She built three of the most
elegant seats that were ever raised by one person in the same
county&mdash;Chatsworth, Hardwick, and Oldcoates; all transmitted
entire to the first Duke of Devonshire.&nbsp; The Countess died
in 1607, aged 87.&nbsp; She bequeathed all her estates to her son
William, Earl of Devonshire; and we find this nobleman to have
been in possession of this mansion at Chelsea soon after her
death.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>William, Earl of Devonshire, received his education with the
sons of the Earl of Shrewsbury, his father in-law; and, being
distinguished for eminent abilities, was advanced to the dignity
of Baron Cavendish, by James I. in the third year of his reign;
at which time of his creation his Majesty stood under a cloth of
state in the hall at Greenwich, accompanied by the princes and
the greatest part of the nobility, both of England and
Scotland.&nbsp; In 1618 he was created Earl of Devonshire.&nbsp;
He died at Hardwick in 1625.&nbsp; The Earl married, to his
second wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Boughton, Esq., of the
county of Warwick, and widow of Sir Richard Wortley.&nbsp; This
lady survived him, and continued to reside at Chelsea till her
death, which happened in 1643, as appears by the parish book, in
which are also entries of the burials of some of her
domestics.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the death of the Countess of Devonshire, this ancient
house became the property of Sir Joseph Alston, who was created a
baronet by Charles II. in 1682.&nbsp; Mrs. Mary Alston, the wife
of this gentleman, died here in 1671, and her funeral sermon was
preached by Dr. Littleton, who published it shortly after, in
quarto.&nbsp; Sir Joseph was in possession of this house in 1664;
it afterwards came into the possession of Mr. Tate, and was
occupied as a stained paper manufactory.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1813 it was pulled down, and the materials sold by a
builder, who had obtained possession; and now not a stone remains
to show where it once stood.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The family of Tate were originally of Chelsea, and had at one
time large property here, which they parted with by
degrees.&nbsp; They attained property also in Leicestershire,
through a marriage with the daughter of Lord Zouch.</p>
<h3><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Bishop
of Winchester&rsquo;s Palace.</h3>
<p>The Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s Palace, which was pulled down
some years since, adjoined the gardens of Alston House, on the
east, and on the site of which is now Oakley Street, and a
terrace of well-built houses, fronting the river.&nbsp; The
houses erected in Oakley Street are throughout of a superior
class, and as the road is of considerable width, with a good
pavement, it now forms the most respectable and important direct
thoroughfare from the King&rsquo;s Road to the centre of Cheyne
Walk.&nbsp; The contemplated embankment and Albert Bridge will be
noticed at the conclusion of this work, so as to get correct
information.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The ancient palace of the Bishops of Winchester, in Southwark,
having been dilapidated and laid waste, an Act of Parliament was
passed in the year 1663 empowering George Morley, Bishop of
Winchester, to lease out the houses in Southwark, and for other
purposes.&nbsp; In the ensuing year the Bishop, in pursuance of
this Act of Parliament, purchased a new brick house at Chelsea,
then lately built by James Duke of Hamilton, and adjoining to the
Manor House, Cheyne Walk, on the east, and Alston House, on the
west, for &pound;4250, to be the future residence of the bishops
of this see, and to be called Winchester House.&nbsp; By the Act
it was held to be within the diocese of Winchester.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Bishopric of Winchester is of good antiquity, and has
never changed the see since its foundation.&nbsp; The Bishops are
Chancellors of the see of Canterbury, and Prelates of the most
noble Order of St. George, called the Garter, which office was
vested in them by King Edward III. at the establishment of that
noble Order, and has continued with them ever since.&nbsp;
Anciently, they were reputed Earls of Southampton, and are so
styled in the Statutes of the Garter, made by Henry VIII.</p>

Tomline was the last Bishop of Winchester who had possession of
this ancient house, but he never resided in it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George Morley, chaplain to Charles I., was a great scholar and
an eminent divine.&nbsp; After the death of the king he retired
to the Hague, where he attended on Charles II.&nbsp; At the
Restoration he was made Dean of Christ Church, and in the same
year Bishop of Worcester, whence he was translated to
Winchester.&nbsp; His constant practice was to rise at five
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, to go to bed at eleven, and to eat
but once a day.&nbsp; By these rules he preserved his health with
very little interruption through the course of a long life.&nbsp;
He died in 1684.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Peter Mews was born at Parscandle, in Dorsetshire, in 1618,
and was educated at Merchant Tailors&rsquo; School, under the
care of Dr. Winiffe, then Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
afterwards Bishop of Lincoln.&nbsp; From school he was elected
scholar to St. John&rsquo;s College, Oxford, and became Fellow of
the same College at the commencement of the civil war.&nbsp; Soon
afterwards he left Oxford, entered the royal army, and was
promoted to the rank of captain; he served for some time, and
then went to Holland.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>During the Interregnum he took holy orders, and at the
Restoration returned to his college, where he took the degree of
D.D.&nbsp; On the death of Dr. Bailey he was made President of
St. John&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; In 1669 he was chosen
Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, and in 1673 he was promoted to the see
of Bath and Wells, which he held for about twelve years, till he
was translated to Winchester.&nbsp; He died 1706, aged 88.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Singular Predictions</span>.&mdash;In
1706, John Needs, a Winchester scholar, foretold the deaths of
Mr. Carman, chaplain to the College, of Dr. Mews, Bishop of
Winchester, and of himself, within that year, to several of his
school-fellows, among others, to George Lavington.&nbsp; This
declaration exposed him naturally to much raillery in the school,
and he was ludicrously styled &ldquo;Prophet Needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Carman died about the time he mentioned.&nbsp; For this
event, however, he had little credit, it being said, that the
death of such an old man might reasonably be expected.&nbsp;
Within the time prefixed Bishop Mews also died by a strange
accident.&nbsp; He was subject to fainting fits, from which he
soon recovered by smelling spirits of hartshorn.&nbsp; Being
seized with a fit whilst a gentleman was with him, and perceiving
its approach, he pointed eagerly to a phial in the window; the
visitor took it, and in haste poured the contents <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>down the
Bishop&rsquo;s throat, which instantly suffocated him.&nbsp; As
the time approached which Needs had prefixed for his own
dissolution, of which he named even the day and the hour, he
sickened, apparently declined, and kept to his chamber, where he
was frequently visited and prayed with by Mr. Fletcher, second
master of the school, and father of the Bishop of Kildare.&nbsp;
This gentleman reasoned and argued with the youth, but in vain;
for with great calmness and composure the patient resolutely
persisted in affirming that the event would verify his
prediction.&nbsp; On the day he had fixed, the house-clock being
kindly put forward, struck the hour before the real time; he saw
through the deception, and told those who were with him, that
when the church clock struck he should expire&mdash;he did
so!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Fletcher left a memorandum in writing to the above
purpose; and Bishop Trimnell, about the year 1722, having heard
this story at Winchester, wrote to New College, of which Mr.
Lavington was then Fellow, for further information.&nbsp; His
answer was, that &ldquo;John Needs had indeed foretold that the
Bishop of Winchester (Mews) and old Mr. Carman should die that
year; but then they being very aged men, he had foretold, for two
or three years before, that they should die in that number of
years.&nbsp; As to foretelling the time of his own death, I
believe he was punctually right.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Lavington gave
the same account to his friends after he was Bishop of
Exeter.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Jonathan Trelawney was a younger son of Sir J. Trelawney, of
Petynt, Cornwall; but his elder brother dying in 1680, he
inherited the title.&nbsp; He was educated at Christ Church,
Oxford, where there is a portrait of him.&nbsp; He was in
succession Bishop of Bristol, Exeter, and Winchester; a man of
polite manners, competent learning, and uncommon knowledge of the
world.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Bishop Trelawney was one of the seven prelates committed to
the Tower by James II. for their efforts to maintain the
Protestant cause.&nbsp; When the news of his probable peril of
life reached Cornwall, the miners proposed coming up to London in
a vast body to demand the bishop&rsquo;s release.&nbsp; The song
in every mouth was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And shall Trelawney die?<br />
And shall Trelawney die?<br />
Then twice five hundred Cornish men<br />
Will know the reason why.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>It is
said that the bishop was open, generous, and charitable, a good
companion, and a good man.&nbsp; He died in 1721. <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles Trimnell, son of the Rev. Charles Trimnell, Rector of
Repton Abbotts, Huntingdonshire, was educated at Oxford.&nbsp; He
was consecrated Bishop of Norwich in 1707; was made Clerk of the
Closet to George I., and translated to the see of Winchester in
1721.&nbsp; This bishop, naturally of a weak constitution, did
not long survive his last promotion.&nbsp; He died at Farnham in
1723, aged 40.&nbsp; This prelate was a steady partizan of the
revolution, which he defended by his pen; warm, yet temperate;
zealous, yet moderate; and his piety did not prevent him from
gaining a perfect knowledge of mankind.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Richard Willis, Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, was
promoted to the deanery of Lincoln, by King William; and in 1714
was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester, translated in 1721 to
Salisbury, and thence to Winchester in 1723, where he resided
till his death, which happened suddenly at Winchester House,
Cheyne Walk, in 1734, aged 71; his wife was buried in Chelsea
Church, in 1727, but he himself was buried in his own
Cathedral.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Bishop Hoadly, a prelate of great merit, was the son of the
Rev. Samuel Hoadly, Master of the Public Grammar School at
Norwich; he was educated at his father&rsquo;s school till he
went to Catherine Hall, Cambridge, where he afterwards became
College Tutor, and appears to have been held in high esteem
throughout the whole course of his academical studies.&nbsp;
Although he applied to study with an intensity of application
that made him eminent, he acquired at the same time considerable
proficiency in music.&nbsp; In 1698 he was ordained, and about
three years afterwards he married Miss Curtis, a great proficient
in the art of painting, many of her portraits exciting public
attention, particularly one of Bishop Burnet.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1704 Mr. Hoadly obtained the rectory of St. Peter le Poor;
he began writing as soon as he came to London; and in 1709 the
following vote was passed in the House of
Commons:&mdash;&ldquo;Resolved, That the Rev. Benjamin Hoadly,
having often justified the principles on which his Majesty and
the nation proceeded in the late happy revolution, hath justly
merited the favour and recommendation of this House.&nbsp; That
an humble <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>address be presented to her Majesty, that she would be
graciously pleased to bestow some dignity in the church on Mr.
Hoadly, for his eminent services, both to the Church and
State.&rdquo;&nbsp; A change of Ministry prevented any benefit
arising to him from this address; but he afterwards had bestowed
on him, by the grandmother of the Duke of Bedford, the rectory of
Streatham, Surrey.&nbsp; Soon after the accession of George I. he
was made Bishop of Bangor.&nbsp; From thence he was successively
translated to those of Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester, which
last he enjoyed nearly twenty-seven years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It is somewhat a singular circumstance, that when Bishop
Hoadly went to Court to kiss the King&rsquo;s hand on his
promotion, he did not know the way up stairs, the attendants
being all busily engaged at the moment, and by mistake he sat
down in an outer room unobserved, and some affirm that he lost
the honour of being presented on that occasion to his
Majesty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The doctrines contained in his publications gave such offence
to the clergy, that they produced the famous Bangorian
Controversy.&nbsp; On the 16th of December, 1761, having supped,
he retired to bed in perfect health, but in the middle of the
night he was seized with a fit of vomiting, of which the violence
abated in about an hour.&nbsp; Medical assistance was immediately
sent for, and the bishop seemed better, but about two
o&rsquo;clock the following even, his lady found him dead,
without knowing the precise moment of his departure.&nbsp; As a
writer, he possessed powerful talents; his greatest defect,
perhaps, was in extending his periods to a disagreeable length;
for which Pope has thus recorded him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But, sir, of writers?&nbsp; Swift for
closer style,<br />
But Hoadly for a period of a mile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amongst the most celebrated writers of modern times, who have
possessed great argumentative powers, this &ldquo;defect&rdquo;
is generally a natural consequence.&nbsp; Lord Brougham, for
instance, was remarkable for the length of his periods, or final
sentences, but with him it evidenced deep thought, and enabled
him to impart into his writings and speeches that eloquence and
force of language for which he was so highly extolled.&nbsp;
Bishop Hoadly might have been one of those &ldquo;powerful&rdquo;
writers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. John Thomas was born in 1696, and in 1733, being then
Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, he was presented by the <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Dean and
Chapter of St. Paul&rsquo;s, to the united parishes of St.
Benedict&rsquo;s and St. Peter&rsquo;s, Paul&rsquo;s Wharf,
London.&nbsp; In 1742 he became Canon Residentiary of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, and was sworn in one of his Majesty&rsquo;s
Chaplains in Ordinary.&nbsp; He was consecrated Bishop of
Peterborough in 1747, and four years after was appointed
Preceptor to the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; On the death of Bishop
Hoadly he was presented to the see of Winchester.&nbsp; Dr.
Thomas died at his episcopal palace, Cheyne Walk, in 1781, aged
85, having sustained throughout life the character of an
exemplary prelate. <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hon. Brownlow North was born in 1741, was the younger son
of the first Earl of Guildford, and brother to that Lord North
who became twice Prime Minister of this country, once during the
American war, and, secondly, in conjunction with Mr. Fox.&nbsp;
Mr. North was first educated at Eton, and afterwards at Trinity
College, Cambridge.&nbsp; In 1770 he was promoted from a canonry
at Christchurch, to the deanery of Canterbury.&nbsp; His elder
brother being now Prime Minister he obtained the mitre of
Lichfield and Coventry in 1771, at the early age of 30.&nbsp; In
1744 he was promoted to the see of Worcester, soon after which he
was promoted to the rich see of Winchester.&nbsp; By his wife,
formerly Miss Bannister, a lady previously well known in the
fashionable world, he had a very numerous family, of whom both
sons and sons-in-law were amply provided with valuable livings in
the church.&nbsp; The bishop with his family went to Italy, and
shortly after their return his lady died; his lordship died at
his palace at Chelsea, after a long illness, accompanied with
blindness, at the age of 79, July 12, 1820.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Bishop North was kind and charitable.&nbsp; The present writer
gladly embraces this opportunity to testify to the truth of this
statement.&nbsp; The bishop was walking in front of his palace,
as was his frequent custom, when the writer, then quite a youth,
fell accidentally with considerable force on the shore of the
river, it being at the time &ldquo;low water.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
bishop observing the accident, and perceiving the injury
sustained, gave immediate instructions for his being carried
home, compensating the men, and offering to pay any additional
expenses.&nbsp; This may appear no more than an act of duty on
the part of the bishop, but the writer cannot refrain from
remembering it as a deed worthy of a &ldquo;good
Samaritan.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Winchester Palace was of humble exterior, and displayed
little of grandeur or of magnificence.&nbsp; It was two stories
in height, and built with red bricks, without pilasters or any
other architectural ornament; but, however plain in its exterior,
it comprised every convenience and comfort that could be required
for a large establishment.&nbsp; The building formed a
quadrangle, and its principal entrance was in the south front,
the ground floor of which comprised the great hall, kitchen, and
chapel, the latter being of moderate dimensions, plainly but
neatly fitted up.&nbsp; The great staircase at the eastern end of
the hall led to three grand drawing rooms, which extended the
whole length of the south front, and which, during the residence
of Bishop North, were splendidly furnished.&nbsp; The walls were
covered with beautiful paper, having gold borders, the ceilings
were richly ornamented in stucco work, and the chimney-pieces
composed of various coloured marbles, put up at considerable
expense by the bishop after his return from Italy.&nbsp; The
sleeping rooms, and other domestic chambers, occupied the whole
north front, commanding fine views over the gardens
adjoining.&nbsp; On the ground floor of this front were two
libraries, and other apartments, bounded on the east by a great
gallery, leading to the gardens.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having been obliged in the year 1791, by the bad health of
part of his family, to seek the climate of Italy, Bishop North
collected there many curious articles of undoubted antiquity, of
modern art, and of natural history, of which the principal were,
Greek sepulchral vases, specimens of ancient marbles used in the
Roman villas, mural paintings from Herculaneum, beautiful works
in Mosaic, fine bronzes, splendid gems, curious china,
&amp;c.&nbsp; These were disposed with much taste in various
apartments of the house, and some of them we will notice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The great entrance hall was 40 ft. long, and 20 ft. wide; on a
table stood an antique juvenile bust of Bacchus, which was much
admired.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The grand staircase was of noble proportions, and was
ornamented with a variety of objects of taste, disposed in glass
cases, consisting of specimens of all the articles of domestic
use among the ancient Romans.&nbsp; Here likewise stood a
sepulchral Roman vase of white marble, ornamented with
rams&rsquo; heads <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>and elegant festoons of white flowers, with the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Semproni&aelig;<br />
Elegantiorib. choreis<br />
Psallendoq; Pr&aelig;stantis<br />

Per crudelia fata dirept&aelig;<br />
Sodaliu.&nbsp; Sibi.&nbsp; Choors.&nbsp; Dilecta<br />

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>In bloom of youth, midst sweet companions

<p style="text-align: right">W. B.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Near the preceding was a plaster cast of Dr. Burney, author of
the History of Music, taken from the original bust by
Nollekens.&nbsp; The three drawing-rooms were of the same
dimensions as the hall; the first was ornamented with several
mosaic and fresco paintings from Herculaneum, and other works of
ancient arts.&nbsp; In the next apartments were portraits of
Bishop North, and his lady.&nbsp; Along the gallery which led to
the garden were disposed, in glass cases, a rich variety of
beautiful shells, with spars and ores, and a large collection of
Italian marbles.&nbsp; The house was also adorned with many
specimens of modern art, in modelling and painting, executed by
Miss North, the Hon. Mr. Brownlow North, and by others of his
lordship&rsquo;s family.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Winchester House was well and expensively supplied with water,
conveyed by pipes from a conduit, built by Henry VIII., situated
in the King&rsquo;s forcing grounds at Kensington.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Upon pulling down the palace a singular discovery was
made.&nbsp; In a small room, to the north front, and at the
north-west corner, were found on the plaster of the walls, nine
figures of the size of life, viz., three men and six women, drawn
in outline with black chalk in a bold and animated style.&nbsp;
Various <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>opinions have been given respecting these spirited
sketches.&nbsp; They displayed much of the <i>manner</i> of
Hogarth, who lived on intimate terms with Bishop Hoadly, and it
was supposed that these figures applied to some domestic incident
in the bishop&rsquo;s family, or to some scene in a play.&nbsp;
His lordship&rsquo;s partiality for the drama was great.&nbsp; A
near relative, who resided in Chelsea, wrote the comedy of
&ldquo;The Suspicious Husband.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The palace remained unoccupied after the death of Bishop
North; for Lady Tomline, the wife of Bishop Tomline, conceived a
dislike to the place altogether.&nbsp; His lordship, in
consequence, applied to Parliament and obtained an Act to enable
him to sell the premises.&nbsp; The Lord of the Manor became the
purchaser; and subsequently the whole fabric was sold by
auction.</p>
<h3>Description of the Manor House.</h3>
<p>As full particulars have already been given of the
distinguished occupiers of the ancient Manor House, Cheyne Walk,
it is here only necessary to describe the structure of this once
celebrated residence. <a name="citation105"></a><a
href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Immediately adjoining Winchester Palace, on the east, was
situated the ancient Manor House and lands.&nbsp; It was a
spacious house, built by Henry VIII., the original consisting of
a rather plain brick structure, one storey above the ground
floor, with irregularly-shaped windows, and divided by four
buttresses of great width, carried up considerably higher than
the roof, either as ornaments or concealed flues.&nbsp; The
parapet of this part was castellated.&nbsp; Two additions, on the
east, seems to have been subsequently added to the original; one
of them being three stories in height, the other of two, without
either buttress or embrasures.&nbsp; The number of windows in the
entire front was thirty-four, and the entrance door accorded with
the period of Henry VIII.&nbsp; The whole presented an idea of
monastic antiquity.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Sir
Hans Sloane, it is said, was buried from the eastern end of the
Manor House.&nbsp; A man, named Howard, who was employed in the
removal of his books, stated that they amounted to nearly 40,000
volumes.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On part of the site of the old Manor House, and adjoining
Winchester Palace, in the first house eastward in Cheyne Walk,
resided for a long time the Rev. Thomas Clare.&nbsp; When the
destruction of the episcopal domain took place, Mr. Clare, with
some difficulty, obtained a portion of the land upon which the
gardens of the above venerable edifice stood, in the arrangement
and disposition of which he omitted nothing which might do
justice to the memory of its former illustrious owners and
occupiers, or excite the approbation of visitors of judgment and
taste.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Richard Steele appears, from the parish books, to have
rented a house by the water-side, rated at &pound;14 per
annum.&nbsp; In a letter from Sir Richard to Lady Steele, dated
Chelsea, 14th of February, 1716, he says, &ldquo;Mr. Fuller and I
came hither to dine in the air, but the maid has been so slow
that we are benighted, and chuse to lie here rather than go this
road in the dark.&nbsp; I lie at our own house, and my friend at
a relation&rsquo;s in the town.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Richard was born about the year 1676, in Ireland, but of
English parents.&nbsp; At a very early age he was sent from
Dublin to London, and was educated with Addison at the Charter
House; from hence he removed to Merton College, Oxford; he left
the University without taking a degree, and entered the army, a
step highly displeasing to his friends.&nbsp; However, as he had
a constant flow of good nature, a generous frankness of spirit,
and a sparkling vivacity of wit, these qualities rendered him the
delight of the soldiery, and having made choice of a profession
which set him free from all the ordinary restraints in youth, he
indulged his inclinations in the wildest excesses.&nbsp; He
became Secretary to Lord Cutts, who obtained for him the rank of
captain in Lord Lucas&rsquo;s regiment of Fusileers; and, in the
beginning of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, he was appointed to the
profitable place of Gazetteer, to which he had been recommended
by Mr. Addison.&nbsp; Steele had already exhibited his talents as
a <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>dramatic writer with success, and in 1709 he began to
publish &ldquo;The Tatler,&rdquo; which was undertaken by him in
concert with Dr. Swift, and others; and by this work his
reputation was perfectly established.&nbsp; This was followed by
&ldquo;The Spectator,&rdquo; which was carried on chiefly by the
assistance of his friend Addison, and the success of this paper
being still superior to that of the former, encouraged him to
proceed in the same design in the character of &ldquo;The
Guardian.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1710 Sir Richard was made a Commissioner of the Stamp
Duties, which office he resigned in 1713; and from a placeman he
became a violent oppositionist.&nbsp; He took his seat in the
House of Commons as Member for Stockbridge, in Hampshire, but was
expelled thence in a few days after for writing several seditious
libels.&nbsp; From this time till the death of Queen Anne his
attention was wholly engrossed in writing and publishing
political tracts. <a name="citation107"></a><a
href="#footnote107" class="citation">[107]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the accession of George I. he was again taken into favour;
was appointed Surveyor to the Royal Stables at Hampton Court, had
the honour of knighthood conferred upon him, and during the whole
of this reign continued to receive many marks of the royal
bounty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It might now naturally be imagined that, taught by ample
experience, Sir Richard would pay some attention to economy:
such, however, was the power of habit, and such was his
thoughtless profusion, that scarcely a twelvemonth had passed
before he was obliged to sell his share in a theatre to relieve
the oppressive exigencies of want.&nbsp; In 1725 he surrendered
the whole of his property to his creditors, and retired to Wales,
where, in the following year, he was seized with a paralytic
stroke, which rendered him incapable of any further literary
effort.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By the indulgence of the mortgagee he resided on his estate,
near Carmarthen, which he had formerly acquired on his marriage
with his second wife.&nbsp; After lingering nearly two years in
this secluded situation, he died September 21, 1729.&nbsp; Such
was the chequered life of Steele, at one time exulting on the
wing of prosperity; at another depressed by all the evils of the
most embittered poverty.&nbsp; His frailties were not the
offspring of vice, but the effects of habitual carelessness and
the want of <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>prudence.&nbsp; Compassionate in his heart; unbounded
in his benevolence; no object of distress that he could relieve
ever left him with a murmur; and in the hour of prosperity he was
ever ready, both with his influence and property, to promote the
views of literature and science, and to assist the efforts of
unprotected genius.&nbsp; Mental wealth, however poor and humble
the possessor, was esteemed by him to be of invaluable worth. <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a></p>
<h3>Don Saltero&rsquo;s Coffee House.</h3>
<p>This well known coffee-house was first opened in the year
1695, by one Salter, who had been a servant to Sir Hans Sloane,
and had accompanied him on his travels.&nbsp; The collection of
curiosities, which were principally the gift of his master, being
the duplicates of his various curious collections, drew from
London a multitude of spectators.&nbsp; It existed for more than
a century, and was at length sold by public auction in the year
1799.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In &ldquo;The Tatler,&rdquo; No. 34, Sir Richard Steele has
given the following humorous description of this once far-famed
collection of rarities, and of its eccentric
proprietor:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Being of a very spare and hective
constitution, I am forced to make frequent journies of a mile or
two for fresh air; and indeed by this last, which was no further
than the village of Chelsea, I am farther convinced of the
necessity of travelling to know the world; for, as it is usual
with young voyagers, as soon as they land upon a shore, to begin
their accounts of the nature of the people, their soil, their
government, their inclinations, and their passions, so really I
fancied I could give you an immediate description of this village
from the Five Fields, where the robbers lie in wait, to the
coffee-house, where the <i>literati</i> sit in council.&nbsp; A
great ancestor of ours, by the mother&rsquo;s <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>side, Mr.
Justice Overdo, (whose history is written by Ben Johnson,) met
with more enormities by walking <i>incognito</i> than he was
capable of correcting; and found great mortifications in
observing, also, persons of eminence, whom he before knew nothing
of: thus it fared with me, even in a place so near the town as
this.&nbsp; When I came into the coffee-house, I had not time to
salute the company, before my eye was diverted by 10,000
gimcracks round the room, and on the ceiling.&nbsp; When my first
astonishment was over, comes to me a sage, of thin and meagre
countenance, which aspect made me doubt whether reading or
fretting had made it so philosophic; but I very soon perceived
him to be of that sect which the ancients call Gingivist&aelig;,
in our language, tooth-drawers.&nbsp; I immediately had a respect
for the man; for these practical philosophers go upon a very
rational hypothesis, not to cure, but to take away the part
affected.&nbsp; My love of mankind made me very benevolent to Mr.
Salter; for such is the name of this eminent barber and
antiquary.&nbsp; Men are usually, but unjustly, distinguished
rather by their fortunes than their talents, otherwise their
patronage would make a great figure in that class of men which I
distinguish under the title of Odd Fellows; but it is the
misfortune of persons of great genius to have their faculties
dissipated by attention to too many things at once.&nbsp; Mr.
Salter is an instance of this; if he would wholly give himself up
to the string, instead of playing twenty beginnings to tunes, he
might, before he dies play <i>Roger de Caubly</i> quite
out.&nbsp; I heard him go through his whole round; and, indeed, I
think he does play the Merry Christ Church Bells pretty justly;
but he confessed to me, he did that rather to show he was
orthodox than that he valued himself upon the music itself.&nbsp;
Or if he did proceed in his anatomy, why might he not hope in
time to cut off legs, as well as draw teeth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The particularity of this man put me into a deep
thought, whence it should proceed that, of all the lower order,
barbers should go further in hitting the ridiculous than any
other set of men: watermen brawl, cobblers sing; but why must a
barber be for ever a politician, a musician, an anatomist, a
poet, and a physician.&nbsp; The learned Vossius says, his barber
used to comb his hair in iambics; and indeed in all ages, one of
this useful profession, this order of cosmetic philosophers, has
been celebrated by the most eminent hands.&nbsp; You see the
barber, in Don Quixote, is one of the principal characters in the
history, which gave me satisfaction in the doubt, why Don Saltero
writ his name with a Spanish termination; for he is descended in
a <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>right
line, not from John Tradescant, as he himself asserts, but from
that memorable companion of the Knight of Mancha; and I hereby
certify, to all the worthy citizens who travel to see his
rarities, that his double-barrelled pistols, targets, coats of
mails, his sclopeta, and sword of Toledo, were left to his
ancestor, by the said ancestor to all his progeny down to Don
Saltero.&nbsp; Though I go thus far in favour of Don
Saltero&rsquo;s merit, I cannot allow a liberty he takes of
imposing several names (without my licence) on the collections he
has made, to the abuse of the good people of England, one of
which is particularly calculated to deceive religious persons, to
the great scandal of the well-disposed, and may introduce
heterodox opinions: he shows you a straw hat, which I know to be
made by Madge Peskad, within three miles of Bedford, and tells
you it is Pontius Pilate&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s chambermaid&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s hat.&nbsp; To my knowledge of this very hat, it
may be added, that the covering of straw was never used among the
Jews, since it was demanded of them to make bricks without
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore this is really nothing, but, under the
specious pretence of learning and antiquity, to impose upon the
world.&nbsp; There are other things which I cannot tolerate among
his rarities, as the china figure of a lady in the glass case,
the Italian engine for the imprisonment of those who go abroad
with it; both of which I hereby order to be taken down, or else
he may expect to have his letters-patent for making punch
superseded, be debarred wearing his muff next winter, or ever
coming to London without his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be thought, perhaps, I have dwelt too long upon
the affairs of this operator; but I desire the reader to remember
that it is my way to consider men as they stand in merit, and not
according to their fortune or figure; and if he is in a
coffee-house at the reading hereof, let him look round, and he
will find there may be more characters drawn in this account than
that of Don Saltero; for half the politicians about him, he may
observe, are, by their place in nature, of the class of
tooth-drawers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The curiosities of this collection were deposited in
glass-cases, and consisted of a great variety of petrifactions,
corals, chrystals, ores, shells, animals preserved in spirits,
stuffed animals from various parts of the world, idols, curious
Chinese manuscripts, missals, birds, snakes, butterflies, medals,
models, fire-arms, fishes, portraits, prints, &amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>A
catalogue of the whole was printed, with the names of the donors
affixed; and under the management of skilful hands this
collection could not have failed to produce ample remuneration
and profit.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Such collections, aided by those of Tradescant, Ashmole, and
Thoresby, cherished the infancy of science, and should not be
depreciated now, as the playthings of a boy are scorned after he
has arrived at manhood.&nbsp; Mr. Pennant&rsquo;s ancestor, who
lived at Chelsea, often took his great nephew, Mr.
Pennant&rsquo;s father, to the coffee-house, where he used to see
poor Richard Cromwell, a little and very neat old man, with a
most placid countenance, the effect of his innocent and
unambitious life.&nbsp; He imagines this was Don Saltero&rsquo;s
coffee-house, to which he was a benefactor, and has the honour of
having his name mentioned in the collection. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Pennant, when a boy, saw &ldquo;his uncle&rsquo;s gift to
the great Saltero,&rdquo; which was &ldquo;a lignified
hog.&rdquo;&nbsp; What Mr. Pennant thus facetiously denominates,
is called, in the edition of Saltero&rsquo;s catalogue that we
have seen, &ldquo;a piece of a root of a tree that grew in the
shape of an hog.&rdquo;&nbsp; He feared this matchless curiosity
was lost; at least, it is omitted in the last, or forty-seventh
edition of the catalogue.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>What author, except Mr. Pennant, can flatter himself with
delivering his works down to posterity in impressions so numerous
as the labours of Don Saltero?</p>
<p>The name of Don Saltero made its first appearance in the
newspaper, June 22nd, 1723; whence the following account of
himself and his rarities is extracted.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir, fifty years since to Chelsea great,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Rodman, on the Irish main,<br />
I stroll&rsquo;d, and maggots in my pate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, much impro&rsquo;d, they still remain.<br />
Through various employes I&rsquo;ve past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A scraper, virtuos&rsquo;, projector,<br />
Tooth drawer, trimmer, and at last<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now a gimcrack-whim collector.<br />
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Monsters
of all sorts here are seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange things in nature as they grow so,<br />
Some relics of the Sheha queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fragments of the fam&rsquo;d Bob Crusoe.<br />
Knick-knacks, too, dangle round the wall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some in glass cases, some on shelf,<br />
But what&rsquo;s the rarest right of all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your humble servant shows himself.<br />
On this my chiefest hope depends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if you will the cause espouse,<br />
In journals pray direct your friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my Museum Coffee-House:<br />
And, in requital for the timely favour,<br />
I&rsquo;ll gratis bleed, draw teeth, and be your shaver.<br />
Nay, that your pate may with my noddle tarry,<br />
And you shine bright as I do&mdash;marry, shall ye<br />
Freely consult your Revelation Molly.<br />
Nor shall one jealous thought create a huff,<br />
For she has taught me manners long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chelsea Knackatory</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">DON SALTERO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Franklin, in his Life, mentions coming to Chelsea to see
Don Saltero&rsquo;s collection:&mdash;&ldquo;We one day (says he)
made a party to go by water to Chelsea, in order to see the
College, and Don Saltero&rsquo;s curiosities.&nbsp; On our
return, at the request of the company, I undressed myself, and
leaped into the river.&nbsp; I swam from near Chelsea the whole
way to Blackfriars Bridge, exhibiting, during my course, a
variety of feats of activity and address, both upon the surface
of the water as well as under it.&nbsp; The sight occasioned much
astonishment and pleasure to those to whom it was new.&nbsp; In
my youth I took great delight in this exercise.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This noted coffee-house was for many years, in the present
century, conducted in a most respectable manner.&nbsp; There was
a subscription room, where gentlemen met and conversed, and which
was frequently visited by men of literature and science, many of
whom are still living, but of late years it had lost the
celebrity of former days.&nbsp; It was rebuilt in 1867, is now a
capital private residence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry Redhead Yorke, Esq.&mdash;This accomplished scholar died
at his residence, at No. 19, Cheyne Walk, in 1813, in the 41st
year of his age.&nbsp; He was a great classical scholar.&nbsp; In
his youth as he himself expressed it, he was &ldquo;madly in love
with ideal liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; He became an officer in the
French army, and <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>a member of the National Convention, and personally
acquainted with all the leading characters of the French
Revolution.&nbsp; He was denounced by Robespierre; and but for a
friendly hint from the celebrated Condorcet, must have been
guillotined, had he been one hour longer in making his
escape.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the month of March, 1798, he was liberated from Dorchester
Castle, after an imprisonment of four years, for a seditious
libel.&nbsp; He had paid a fine of &pound;200, and entered into
securities for &pound;2,000.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some years previous to his death his political ideas became
moderated, and he manifested a strong sense of the value of the
British constitution.&nbsp; He had been called to the bar; a
profession for which he was highly qualified, and in which there
was every reason to hope he would have risen to high eminence,
had his life been prolonged.&nbsp; Indeed, the zeal with which he
devoted himself to his various professional pursuits, hastened,
if it did not bring on, the disorder which put a period to his
existence at the comparative early age of forty-one years.&nbsp;
As a classical scholar, and nervous elegant writer, he has left
few equals.&nbsp; His letters, under the signature of
&ldquo;Galgacus,&rdquo; have scarcely been surpassed since the
days of Junius.&nbsp; In private life, Mr. Yorke was
distinguished for benevolence and liberality of sentiment,
openness of character, and his company was courted by men of all
parties.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Francis Chalmer, Esq., (son of Edmund Chalmer, Esq.,) resided
in Cheyne Row for a great many years.&nbsp; He was a magistrate
for the county, and highly esteemed in the parish.&nbsp; As a
gentleman he was affable and courteous, and kind to the
poor.&nbsp; He died at his house in Cheyne Row, in July, 1859,
and was interred in the Brompton Cemetery.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Leigh Hunt, Esq., the well-known author of many interesting
works, and who was the associate of the most distinguished
political as well as literary men of the earlier part of the
present century, occupied a house in Upper Cheyne Row for a
considerable time.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Miss Frances Elizabeth Eggleton, and Miss Christian Mary
Eggleton, lived in Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; They were the daughters of
Mr. David Eggleton, of Church Street, a very old Chelsea
family.&nbsp; The former lady died in 1861, and the latter in
1867.&nbsp; Miss Frances Eggleton bequeathed a sum of money, to
be given <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>at her sister&rsquo;s death to the Rector and
Churchwardens, in trust, for them to give, on Christmas Eve,
&ldquo;a shoulder of mutton of not less than seven pounds in
weight, and not exceeding eight pounds in weight, and four pounds
of bread, to each of twenty poor persons of Chelsea, being
married persons and having a family.&rdquo;&nbsp; An extract from
her will, respecting this gift, will be inserted amongst the
other parochial legacies.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles Rawlings, Esq., who resided in Cheyne Walk for many
years, was much respected in the parish, and was of a most
benevolent disposition.&nbsp; His deed of gift in 1862, and the
legacies in 1864, will be found in the list of Chelsea
Charities.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Bayford, a distinguished proctor, and father of the
present Dr. Bayford, resided with his family in a spacious house,
within a few doors of Manor Street.&nbsp; His sons, in their
younger days, were particularly attached to aquatic
exercises.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Nathaniel Handford, Esq., an old and respected parishioner,
resided also in Cheyne Walk, where he died.&nbsp; Mrs. Sarah
Handford, his relict, who did not very long survive him, left
several small legacies, in 1865, to various charitable societies
in the parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>W. Carpenter, Esq., well-known in literary circles, and who
has long been connected with the press, resided likewise within
the last few years in Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>R. E. N. Lee, Esq., occupied the house at the corner of Manor
Street, (now in possession of Dr. Sannemann,) for a considerable
period.&nbsp; He was Steward of the Manor for eighteen
years.&nbsp; He died in 1833, and in St. Luke&rsquo;s Church
there is a tablet to his memory.&nbsp; No family was more
respected in Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. J. Fraine, a solicitor, resided at No. 13, in Cheyne Walk,
and died in 1785, aged 70.&nbsp; The history of this gentleman
and his family was marked by some very uncommon
circumstances.&nbsp; He was himself afflicted with a continual
gnawing pain in his left arm, which he carried on a board in a
sling; and by pinching his jaws and throat, and beating his right
cheek through the violence of the pain, he had marked them very
much.&nbsp; He compared the sensation to a worm in the marrow of
the upper bone of his arm, and used to keep a boy to beat it with
a stick <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>whenever the pain returned, and to tap on the back of
his head with a piece of wood covered with cloth.&nbsp; Mr.
Fraine&rsquo;s death was occasioned by the fall on his right
thigh of a leaden weight, with which he was exercising as a
remedy for his complaint; the injury brought on a speedy
mortification.&nbsp; This extraordinary case was fully described
in a letter, subsequently written by Dr. Monsey.&nbsp; The
calamities of this unhappy gentleman extended also to his son and
daughter, both of whom fell by their own hands.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Fraine&rsquo;s only son.&nbsp; King Samuel, an amiable,
accomplished young man, who received his education at Christ
Church, Cambridge, put an end to his existence at his chambers in
the Temple, in 1799, aged 22 years, for which no reason can be
assigned but disappointment in love.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Miss Fraine, whose duteous attention to her tortured and
frequently impatient father was most exemplary, after the
dreadful catastrophe of her brother&rsquo;s suicide, not wholly
unaccountable from hereditary irregularities of system, seemed to
have a dread (not aversion) of marriage.&nbsp; The tendency of
her social feelings, strictly regulated and controlled by the
reserve of modesty and the dignity of virtue, almost irresistibly
inclined her best affections towards wedlock; whilst her
extremely sensitive forethought shunned the general result of
engagements ennobling to mankind in general, but appalling in
many lights to herself.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>During this state of mind, repeatedly avowing her contempt for
birds, cats, and dogs, she expressed great attachment for infant
children.&nbsp; Miss Fraine, in 1780, frequently expressed to a
very near neighbour her ardent wish that a particular child were
placed under her own sole and immediate management.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot safely marry,&rdquo; she would often observe,
&ldquo;but I shall undertake the charge of an infant&rsquo;s
education with delight.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After making many serious colloquial attempts to reason
against such an intention, the Rev. Weeden Butler sent some
sportive lines to the highly gifted and unfortunate lady.&nbsp;
It succeeded so far as to repress any further application by the
lady, but her feelings remained the same.&nbsp; The following
elegant jeu-d&rsquo;esprit was written with similar effect.&nbsp;
She appears to have possessed great sensibility of feeling
without adequate reflection.</p>
<h3><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>SALE

<blockquote><p>In fairy guise and playful mood,<br />
Euphrania, young and fair, and good,<br />
Vows, if her friends a price would set<br />

Herself the gift of Heaven would buy,<br />

She married Captain Fortescue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Dominiceti&rsquo;s
Baths</span>.&mdash;The dwelling house afterwards occupied by the
Rev. Weeden Butler, a few doors from Flood Street, Cheyne Walk,
was once inhabited by one Dominiceti, an Italian physician, of
very considerable notoriety and talents.&nbsp; At this house he
established medicinal baths for the cure of all diseases; and it
was fitted up with pipes, &amp;c., for the accommodation of
numerous patients, who might choose to reside with him while they
were under his care.&nbsp; In 1765 it is described as a large,
pleasant, and convenient house, which contains four spacious and
lofty parlours, two dining rooms, and thirteen bed
chambers.&nbsp; On the east side of the garden, and directly
communicating with the house, was erected an elegant brick and
wooden building, 100-ft. long, and 16-ft. wide, in which were the
baths and fumigatory stoves, etc.&nbsp; It appears, from his own
account, that he expended about &pound;37,000 altogether in
erecting, contriving, and completing his house, and baths in
Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among his visitors and patients, at Chelsea, was his Royal
Highness Edward Duke of York, who entrusted the preservation of
his life to Dominiceti&rsquo;s sole direction for above a month;
and that in direct opposition to the advice of the Physicians and
Surgeons of the Royal household.&nbsp; Sir John Fielding, having
experienced the good effects, as he considered, of these baths,
wrote a &ldquo;Vindication of Dr. Dominiceti&rsquo;s Practice of
removing various afflicting diseases by medicated baths, stoves,
fumigations, and frictions, founded on facts.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dominiceti resided for several years in Chelsea.&nbsp; He
became bankrupt in the parish in 1782, and at length disappeared,
overwhelmed with debt.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We will now notice one of the most distinguished scholars and
clergymen of the early part of the present century, the Rev.
Weeden Butler, who resided in the above-mentioned house for a
great many years, and also one of his sons, etc., until a
comparatively recent period, and which cannot fail to be highly
interesting to a large number of readers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>The
Rev. Weeden Butler was born at Margate, in 1742.&nbsp; When aged
fourteen, he lost both his parents; and with his own free will
was articled as clerk to Mr. Rosewell, a respectable solicitor,
in Angel Court, Throgmorton Street, London.&nbsp; At the
expiration of his term, he was offered by his considerate late
master and constant friend till death, a share in the business;
but he had determined to renounce for ever the profession of the
law, and resolved, by intense study and application, to improve
his superior intellectual powers, and ardently to prepare himself
for holy orders.&nbsp; About this time, he frequented all the
churches and chapels within and around the vast metropolis, as an
enquirer after truth.&nbsp; The result of his search fixed his
choice, and he devoted his time thenceforth, as a firm member of
the Establishment, upon the fullest conviction of its
excellence.&nbsp; The course of his classical and theological
reading was directed by that splendidly and variously gifted, but
most unhappy character, Dr. William Dodd, to whom, for a salary
of small extent, he acted as an assiduous amanuensis, till his
patron&rsquo;s ignominious death, in 1777.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Dodd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commentary on the Holy Bible,&rdquo;
was partly compiled, and wholly written out for the press, by the
then unknown Rev. Weeden Butler, who also greatly assisted in
editing the four last volumes of &ldquo;The Christian&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rdquo; and corrected the proof sheets of the poem, in
blank vase, &ldquo;Thoughts in Prison,&rdquo; of which Dr.
Dodd&rsquo;s own MS. was in the possession of Mr. Butler&rsquo;s
eldest son in 1829&ndash;30.&nbsp; In this last singularly
affecting composition occur lines indicative of the worth of the
person eulogized, and of the author&rsquo;s gratitude:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But I am lost! a criminal
adjudg&rsquo;d!<br />
A guilty miscreant! can&rsquo;st thou think, my friend!<br />
Oh! <span class="smcap">Butler</span> &rsquo;midst a million
faithful found;<br />
Oh! can&rsquo;st thou think, who know&rsquo;st, who long hast
known,<br />
My inmost soul; oh! can&rsquo;st thou think, that life,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Dodd resigned his office of Morning Preacher, in Charlotte
Street Chapel, Pimlico, in February, 1776, and at his strong
recommendation, Dr. Courtney nominated the deserving Reader, Mr.
Butler, who was licensed Morning Preacher accordingly; and
afterwards by purchase he became proprietor of the chapel,
officiating therein up to the year 1814.&nbsp; When the subject
of the present article retired from Chelsea, to Gayton; where he
piously discharged the duties of curate to his <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>second son,
till his increasing infirmities compelled him to resign this his
last charge, and he finally withdrew to Greenhill, in the
neighbourhood of Harrow, where he died.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He was master of the school in Cheyne Walk for forty years;
where many persons of considerable rank had been so thoroughly
grounded in morality and general learning as to become bright
ornaments to their country.&nbsp; Amongst other scholars, the
Rev. Weeden Butler had the gratification of seeing his two sons
treading assiduously in his own paths.&nbsp; The Rev. G. Butler,
D.D., in 1805, was chosen Head Master of Harrow School, and
continued as such, with great reputation, for many years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The elder Mr. Butler was one of the earliest institutors of
the &ldquo;Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons
imprisoned for small debts,&rdquo; and most materially assisted
James Neild, Esq., his next door neighbour, in firmly
establishing that excellent Institution.&nbsp; The friendship,
indeed, which existed between these two benevolent characters,
cannot be better exemplified and attested than by the following
few extracts from a letter written by Mr. Neild, dated Chelsea,
January 1, 1808.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I look back to the distant period of our lives,
and observe, that, of the first Committee of the Society, you,
Rev. Sir, and myself, remain the only survivors, I cannot but
feel the most powerful, and, at the same time, the most humble
gratitude to the Great Disposer of all human events, for having
suffered me to live and witness the happy result of our early and
well-meant endeavours. * * * * With growing and well-merited
esteem, Sir, I witnessed your successful exertions in behalf of
the Society, at its earliest institution.&nbsp; Often have I felt
the influence acknowledged by all who have heard the eloquent and
impressive discourses which you have delivered from the pulpit,
in recommendation of the objects embraced by this Charity, and
never can the gratifying recollection be effaced which beamed
from every countenance around you, when you mentioned the receipt
of &pound;100 from an eminent advocate for suffering
humanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Neild concludes by referring to the
promotion of Mr. Butler&rsquo;s son (Dr. Butler), which he
considers to be the reward of his virtues; of those early
advances which his father&rsquo;s tuition enabled him to make in
literature, and to the purity of his Christian principles.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1787 he instituted the Chelsea Sunday Schools, with the
sanction of the Rev. W. B. Cadogan.&nbsp; His Royal Highness the
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>Duke of
Kent had a great regard for Mr. Butler, and appointed him one of
his domestic chaplains.&nbsp; Hardly one charitable Society in
London existed, to which his popular oratory did not essentially
contribute credit and profit.&nbsp; He died in a good old age,
and his remains were placed in the family vault at Chelsea.&nbsp;
The Rev. Weeden Butler, his eldest son, occupied the same house
for many years afterwards, as also the son of the latter, Thomas
Butler, Esq., who was much esteemed by a numerous circle of
friends while he resided in Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; The whole of this
family were remarkable for their classical attainments and love
of literature.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Helmore, Precentor, St.
Mark&rsquo;s College, has since resided in Mr. Butler&rsquo;s
house.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A very fine portrait of Dr. Dodd, painted by Gainsborough, and
a large quarto volume of the doctor&rsquo;s unedited poems, in
MS., bound, including a tragedy, called &ldquo;The
Syracusans,&rdquo; and a comedy, called &ldquo;Sir Roger de
Coverly,&rdquo; were left by Mr. Butler, to his legatees.&nbsp;
The portrait is the only likeness extant The Rev. Philip Dodd,
and the Rev. Weeden Butler (eldest son of Mr. Butler), possessed
all the Doctor&rsquo;s unprinted sermons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>James Neild, Esq., who resided at No. 4, Cheyne Walk, was born
in 1744, at Knutsford, in Cheshire, in the neighbourhood of which
his family had some good estates.&nbsp; He came to London, and
was placed with Mr. Hemming, the King&rsquo;s goldsmith, but
after a short time, he removed to a jeweller&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In
1770 he settled in St. James&rsquo;s Street, and continued there
till the year 1792, when finding his health declining, and having
recently lost his wife, he retired from business to Chelsea, with
an ample fortune.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The attention of Mr. Neild, very early in life, was drawn to
the distressed state of persons imprisoned for debt; the
endeavour to alleviate which soon became his favorite pursuit,
and one which he followed with intense application.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1773, having previously visited most of the prisons in
England, and many on the continent, he was, together with his
benevolent friends, Dr. John C. Lettson, and the Rev. Weeden
Butler, chiefly instrumental in instituting the Society for the
Relief and Discharge of Persons imprisoned for small debts.&nbsp;
In 1812 he published &ldquo;The State of the Prisons,&rdquo; in a
quarto volume, a work teeming with valuable information.&nbsp;
Mr. Neild died in 1814, and was buried in Battersea Church.&nbsp;
He married a daughter of John Camden, Esq., of that parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>John
Camden Neild, Esq., was a magistrate for the county, and the son
of the preceding.&nbsp; He resided in his late father&rsquo;s
house in Cheyne Walk, and bequeathed half a million of money to
Queen Victoria.&nbsp; He died in 1852.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Goss, Esq., the present organist of St. Paul&rsquo;s
Cathedral, lived at No. 3, Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; He was appointed
Organist of St. Luke&rsquo;s New Church, when that sacred edifice
was completed.&nbsp; His proficiency, even at that early period
of his musical life, excited general admiration, and large
portions of the congregation frequently waited in the Church, at
the close of Divine Service, to listen to his concluding
performances.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There are several highly respectable families, who have for
many years resided in Cheyne Walk, of whom it would have been
only an act of justice to notice, but the strict rules of
propriety prevent my discharging an otherwise pleasing duty,
which, in some instances especially, is much to be regretted, as
they take a deep interest in the promotion of whatever tends to
enhance the welfare of the parish.</p>
<h3>DOGGETT&rsquo;S COAT AND BADGE.</h3>
<p>Mr. Thomas Doggett, a native of Ireland, was an actor, and
made his first appearance in Dublin; but his efforts not meeting
with sufficient encouragement he removed to London, where he
performed with great reputation, and by his talents, industry,
and economy, acquired a competent fortune, and quitted the stage
some years before he died.&nbsp; He was also a patentee and
manager of the theatre with Wilks, Booth, and Cibber; the latter
of whom gives Doggett the following character:&mdash;&ldquo;He
was the most original and the strictest observer of nature of all
his cotemporaries.&nbsp; He borrowed from none of them; his
manner was his own, he was a pattern to others, whose greatest
merit was that they had sometimes tolerably imitated him.&nbsp;
In dressing a character to the greatest exactness, he was <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>remarkably
skilful; the least article of whatsoever habit he wore seemed in
some measure to speak the different humour he presented, a
necessary care in a comedian, in which many have been too remiss
or ignorant.&nbsp; His greatest success was in characters of
lower life, which he improved from the delight he took in his
observations of that kind in the real world.&nbsp; In songs, and
particular dances too of humour, he had no competitor.&nbsp;
Congreve was a great admirer of him, and found his account in the
characters he expressly wrote for him.&nbsp; In those of
Fondlewife in his Old Bachelor, and Ben in Love for Love, no
author and actor could be more obliged to their mutual masterly
performances.&nbsp; He was very acceptable to several persons of
high rank and taste, though he seldom cared to be the comedian,
but among his more intimate acquaintances.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>He is highly spoken of in the Spectator.&nbsp; He wrote one
play, called &ldquo;The Country Wake,&rdquo; a comedy, acted with
great applause; and out of this play were made two farces,
&ldquo;Hob, or the Country Wake,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hob&rsquo;s
Wedding.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first has been acted often with great
success, and likewise several songs have been added to it in
imitation of the Beggar&rsquo;s Opera, since which it has been
acted under the title of Flora.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In his political principles he was, in the words of Sir
Richard Steele, &ldquo;a Whig up to head and ears;&rdquo; and he
took every occasion of demonstrating his loyalty to the house of
Hanover.&nbsp; One instance, among others, is well known; which
is, that in the year after King George I. came to the throne, in
1715, Doggett gave a waterman&rsquo;s orange-coloured coat and
silver badge to be rowed for; on the latter is represented the
Hanoverian horse.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This contest takes place on the 1st day of August, being the
anniversary of that King&rsquo;s accession to the throne, between
six young watermen, who had just completed their apprenticeship;
the claimants starting off on a signal being given at that time
of the tide when the current is strongest against them, and
rowing from the Old Swan, near London Bridge, to the White Swan,
at Chelsea.&nbsp; This tavern adjoined the Apothecaries&rsquo;
Botanical Garden, on the east, and enjoyed a great share of
public favour for many years; but in the year 1780, it was
converted into a Brewhouse.&nbsp; Since this period, the place of
landing the victor has been at a house bearing the same sign, <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>near to
Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; I have been favoured with the following
chorus, said to be written by a waterman:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let your oars, like lightning flog it,<br
/>
Up the Thames as swiftly jog it,<br />
An&rsquo; you&rsquo;d win the prize of Doggett,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The glory of the river!<br />
Bendin&rsquo;, bowin&rsquo;, strainin&rsquo;, rowin&rsquo;,<br />
Perhaps the wind in fury blowin&rsquo;,<br />
Or the tide agin you flowin&rsquo;,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The coat and badge for ever!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Doggett, at his death, left a sum of money, the interest
of which was to pay for the same for ever.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Yorkshire Grey&rdquo; public house stood at the
west corner of Old Manor Street, opposite the river.&nbsp; It was
a very old tavern, mostly frequented of late years by the
watermen who plied at the stairs opposite to it.&nbsp; It has
recently been pulled down, and two good private dwelling houses
now occupy the site.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the year 1824, a new road was opened, connecting Old and
New Manor Street, forming a direct communication from Cheyne Walk
to the King&rsquo;s Road, and St. Luke&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp;
Prior to that period a large garden crossed the street, with a
wall and iron railing, so that the two streets were entirely
detached.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With respect to the embankment of the shores of our parish,
this was certainly the work of ages, much posterior to the Norman
Conquest, nor was it even completed before the latter end of the
seventeenth century, for, from the manorial records, we find them
to have been frequently imperfect, whilst the keeping them in
repair and good order, was a subject of vexatious dispute between
the Lord of this Manor and his tenants; and hence sometimes by
the parish and the turnpike trust; sometimes by those persons who
inhabited houses immediately in front of the River, to the extent
of their own frontages; and sometimes by the Lords of the Manor
themselves, to the extent of their frontages.&nbsp; This
uncertainty respecting the right of repair was attended with many
evils, the walls being often out of order, and in a dangerous
state.&nbsp; In December, 1822, upon the trial of an indictment
on the prosecution of the Kensington <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>turnpike trust, against the Lords of
the Manor, in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, the Chief Justice
ruled at <i>nisi prius</i>, that the <i>onus</i> rested on the
latter, unless and until they could show on whom by right of
tenure, or otherwise, the burthen lay.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having now arrived at the conclusion of Book I., in which are
described all that is worthy of special notice in a great portion
of the western extremity of the parish, I shall commence Book
II., with a description of that beautiful architectural
structure, St. Luke&rsquo;s Church.</p>

<h3>St. Luke&rsquo;s Church and the Burial Ground.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will be necessary before we give
a description of this beautiful edifice to state some particulars
respecting the Burial Ground, or, more properly speaking, the
Cemetery, in the centre of which the Church is erected.&nbsp; The
Act of Parliament for providing this additional Burial Ground for
the parish was passed in 1810, and certain Trustees therein named
were appointed to carry it into effect.&nbsp; They accordingly
purchased of Earl Cadogan, the Lord of the Manor, a piece of
ground, in the present central situation, containing rather more
than four acres, and enclosed it with a substantial wall and
strong iron railing.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>As I was present at the consecration of this Burial Ground,
and also of the Church, a brief account of which I published at
the time, the following particulars I can fully
authenticate.&nbsp; With respect to many circumstances which I
shall mention, in connexion with the Church, they may be relied
upon as being accurately stated from my own personal
observation.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>In
November, 1812, the enclosure of the spacious new Burial Ground
having been in every respect completed, with a small Chapel
erected close to the entrance on the north side, designed
exclusively for reading the Funeral Service, on Saturday, the
21st of the above month, the same were consecrated by the Bishop
of London, accompanied by his Chaplains, the Chancellor and
Registrar of the Diocese, the Hon. and Rev. Dr. Wellesley,
rector, the Churchwardens, Trustees, and a large number of the
inhabitants.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The preliminary prayers were offered at the Old Church, and
the Bishop having declared his assent to the petition presented
to him for consecrating the new ground, the procession proceeded
from the Church.&nbsp; On their arrival there was an immense
assemblage to witness the consecration.&nbsp; The Bishop then
perambulated the ground, reading such portions of the Service as
is specially appointed, and afterwards completed the consecration
in the Chapel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the year 1819, an Act of Parliament, 59 Geo. III., cap. 35,
May 19, was obtained for building a new Church, and the Rector
and Churchwardens, and 59 other inhabitants of the parish, were
appointed to carry the same into effect.&nbsp; The central
portion of the new Burial Ground was appropriated for this
purpose, and on the 12th of October, 1820, the first stone of the
new Church was laid by the Hon. and Rev. Dr. Wellesley, as proxy
for his brother, the Duke of Wellington, who was prevented from
performing the ceremony by receiving &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s
commands to attend him on public business that day at his palace
in Pall Mall.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of the vast assemblage of
spectators having waited a long time for His Grace&rsquo;s
arrival felt somewhat disappointed, and some of them attributed
his absence to the political excitement which prevailed just at
that period, but this was far from being the general opinion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A procession was at last formed in the following
order:&mdash;His Royal Highness the Duke of York&rsquo;s Band;
the Beadles of the Parish; Mr. James Savage, the architect; the
Builder, with a silver trowel on a crimson velvet cushion; the
Treasurer, with a metal box and sundry coins, and a brass plate,
on a velvet cushion.&nbsp; The Hon. and Rev. Dr. Wellesley,
rector, supported by the Churchwardens; the Curates and Lecturer
of the Parish, and the Trustees appointed under the Act of
Parliament for building the Church.</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>The
service used on similar occasions having been read by the Rector,
the box with the coins, and the brass-plate were deposited by the
Rector upon the stone prepared for the purpose, which was then
lowered down and secured with the customary formalities.&nbsp;
The inscription on the stone was as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;This
stone was laid on the 12th day of October, A.D., 1820, by Field
Marshal His Grace the Duke of Wellington, the Hon. and Rev.
Gerald Valerian Wellesley, Rector; Richard Rattenbury and Richard
Mann, Churchwardens.&rdquo;&nbsp; The day was remarkably fine,
and the spectacle altogether produced a very imposing effect,
notwithstanding the disappointment experienced by the absence of
the Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; A spacious amphitheatre was erected
for the accommodation of ladies, and the ceremony concluded with
a beam of satisfaction on the countenances of nearly all
present.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Church is built of Bath stone, in the Gothic style of the
14th century, and is approached by a sweep carriage way and
flagged footpath.&nbsp; The west front has an arcade, extending
the whole breadth of the frontage.&nbsp; From the centre of this
arcade rises a lofty tower, the upper part panelled and crowned
with an open battlement.&nbsp; It is strengthened at the four
corners by octagonal buttresses, which are finished by
open-worked pinnacles, of a form which gives the exterior of the
edifice a very picturesque appearance, and when seen at a
distance is very attractive.&nbsp; The height from the ground to
the top of the pinnacle is 142 feet, and the view from the tower
on which these pinnacles rise, affords a very fine view of the
parish and its surrounding scenery.&nbsp; From the tower, the
body of the building is seen to extend, embraced and supported by
its flying buttresses, which stretch their airy fronts from
between the Clerestery windows to the outer wall of the side
aisles, when they are continued solidly down to the ground.&nbsp;
The walls of the side aisles and Clerestery are both finished
with perforated parapets of elegant forms.</p>
<p>At the eastern end, the principal feature is the altar window,
32 ft. high and 16 ft. wide, divided by mullions into seven bays
in width, and four stories in height, exclusive of the pointed
arched head, which has a beautiful wheel centre.&nbsp; This end
has also two octagonal turrets, the upper stories of which are
ornamented with open-worked panels and crocketted domes.&nbsp;
There are also two porches communicating with lobbies and
staircase, to afford the most ample entrance and exit.&nbsp; In
the middle part, and below the great window, the Vestry Room is
projected.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>On
the flanks the buttresses project about six feet, and their
extremities are connected by a dwarf wall, which defends an open
area, giving light and air to the crypt under the Church.&nbsp;
The unbroken line of this wall makes a solid base for the whole
building, which gets lighter and lighter as it ascends to the
top, where numerous feathery pinnacles impart softness and
richness to the extremity that meets the sky.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From the great western arcade you enter by three sets of
folding doors to the vestibule, at the sides of which are placed
the principal staircases to the galleries.&nbsp; The principal or
middle aisle of the Church is entered from the centre of the
entrance lobby by lofty folding doors, glazed with plate glass,
and as there is no western gallery to project before these doors
you have at once the full effect of the interior.&nbsp; In this
Church, unlike most others, the western gallery is obtained by a
recess over the vestibule, and is principally occupied by a
splendid organ by Nicholls, comprising the great organ, choir
organ, and swell organ, containing thirty-three stops and 1876
pipes.&nbsp; The organ is considered one of the finest and most
powerful in London.&nbsp; The bellows, when charged, contains 70
cubic feet of wind. <a name="citation128"></a><a
href="#footnote128" class="citation">[128]</a>&nbsp; The
King&rsquo;s Arms, placed in front of the organ, is executed in a
solid piece of mahogany, and is a masterly production.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The inside of the Church is 130 feet long, and 61 feet wide,
divided into a nave and two side aisles, separated by clustered
columns and pointed arches.&nbsp; The small column in front of
the cluster continues up to the vaulted ceiling, and there
branches out into numerous ribs, which spread their airy lines in
the most graceful manner over the ceiling, tied together at their
numerous intersections by carved pendant bosses, the principal
light being from the clerestery windows gives an aerial effect to
the ceiling, which hardly appears to belong to &ldquo;mid
earth,&rdquo; although actually built of solid stone, whose power
of gravitation appears here to be suspended by the magic of art,
of which this is said to be the only instance of the kind
attempted for the last 300 years.&nbsp; From the pavement to the
crown of the vault is 60 ft., clear height, a greater height than
is to be found in any edifice in London, excepting St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; The lofty
position of the windows diffuses a clear and <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>calm light
throughout.&nbsp; The church was for some years lighted by
oil-lamps in the three really magnificent chandeliers, but for a
long time gas has been very judiciously substituted.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A circumstance occurred in reference to these massive and
splendid central chandeliers, at nearly the conclusion of one of
the Sunday Evening Services, which occasioned great excitement
amongst the congregation, and it was feared at the time would be
attended with loss of life, but fortunately only one elderly
person was seriously injured.&nbsp; These chandeliers were
obliged to be lowered by means of a windlass, and men from the
contractor for lighting the church, by oil-lamps, had to attend
and lower them both before and after Divine Service, in the first
instance for the purpose of lighting, and secondly to extinguish
the lights.&nbsp; It was the practice of these men, who came from
London, and were anxious to return home as soon as possible, to
lower the weighty chandeliers on a certain signal being given to
them at the belfry door, as soon as the organist commenced
&ldquo;playing the congregation out,&rdquo; but on this occasion
it was a sermon in aid of a charity, and the organ was only
played previous to the singing of a hymn while the collection was
being made.&nbsp; This caused the mistake.&nbsp; Some of the
congregation in the galleries, perceiving that one of the
chandeliers was unsteady and slowly descending, rushed forward to
make their exit, which created great confusion and alarm, the
result being the accident previously mentioned.&nbsp; The Hon.
and Rev. Dr. Wellesley, rector, being present, although not
officiating, immediately explained the circumstances, and soon
afterwards the alarm was allayed and the service concluded.&nbsp;
The lighting of these oil-lamps was attended with great expense
and much labour.&nbsp; A considerable saving is now effected by
the introduction of gas, labour on the Sunday is lessened, and
the dirt occasioned by the trimming of the lamps altogether
obviated.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The galleries, south and north, are well constructed.&nbsp;
There is breadth of surface and simplicity of outline
throughout.&nbsp; From some positions the columns of the nave,
which impart such a grandeur to the entire interior, impedes the
view of the preacher, even from the northern gallery, but this is
unavoidable in Gothic architecture.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the eastern end, the great window, 32 ft. high, and 16 ft.
wide, is a most conspicuous feature.&nbsp; The bottom of the
window, being 22 ft. from the pavement, affords ample space <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>for the
altar-piece, which is designed in the manner of a Gothic shrine
or screen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The altar, or communion, is ascended by three steps, and is
enclosed by a Gothic railing.&nbsp; The chairs and stools are
designed in character, and are good specimens of wood carving;
they were executed by Mr. Relph, from the designs of the
architect.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The altar-piece is &ldquo;The Entombing of Christ,&rdquo; by
Northcote.&nbsp; It had been previously exhibited at the British
Institution, Pall Mall.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For some years after the church was completed the large
eastern window was glazed simply with plain glass, as will be
seen from the following Vestry Minute, dated April 24,
1823:&mdash;&ldquo;It is the opinion of this Vestry that it would
be expedient to have a stained-glass window at the east end,
&amp;c., and that the money necessary for the same be attempted
to be raised by voluntary subscriptions.&rdquo;&nbsp; This effort
proved unsuccessful, and on the 29th of August, in the same year,
Thomas Bryan, Esq., of.&nbsp; Cadogan Place, transmitted the
following letter to a subsequent Vestry meeting: &ldquo;Since I
had the honour of being appointed treasurer for the purpose of
receiving voluntary contributions for the purchase of a
stained-glass window, I beg to announce that I have not received
any money but what has been duly returned to the
parties.&rdquo;&nbsp; This great defect has since been remedied,
and a very handsome and appropriate stained-glass window,
representing the apostles, &amp;c., now adds materially to the
beautiful appearance of the interior of the church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The vestry is a large room, 28 ft. square, and is finished in
character with the general style of the building.&nbsp; For some
years the meetings of the parishioners were held in it.&nbsp; The
proceedings on some occasions were very noisome, and as they
frequently took place on Wednesday mornings, or on special days
for prayer, there was at times such an interruption as rendered
it impossible for the clergyman to proceed.&nbsp; The Act of
Parliament since passed, and the erection of the Vestry Hall, in
the King&rsquo;s Road, have happily for ever removed that cause
of complaint.&nbsp; In this vestry room, at the church, there is
an exceedingly good portrait of Mr. Flood, an oil painting, in a
large and handsome frame.&nbsp; It is an admirable likeness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>The
following is another description of the interior of this edifice,
written by a gentleman who has favoured the public with an
accurate detail of most of the modern Churches erected some few
years since in the vicinity of London.&nbsp; It will be seen that
this account, as regards some of the architectural particulars,
supplies several deficiencies in the preceding description, while
at the same time there are inserted in the former many
interesting details which could not possibly be included in a
second notice of the interior of the church.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the west end is a vestibule, extending across the whole
building, and occupying the space beneath the organ gallery and
staircase.&nbsp; This is separated from the church by a fine
stone screen, consisting of a large pointed arch, flanked by
square open buttresses, and ornamented above with a range of
upright divisions, finished with a blank cornice; in the centre
is a bow, or projection in the corbel style, in the front of
which is a dial.&nbsp; The doorway is formed of carved oak,
representing tracery work and mullions, the upper part of the
panelling being pierced and glazed.&nbsp; Above this screen is
the organ, in a carved oak case, the design of which is an
assemblage of three towers, with pinnacles at the angles, and
united by flying buttresses, the wood work ornamented with
upright arched panels.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On each side of the church are seven arches, resting upon six
octangular columns, to each of which four small pillars are
attached, an additional one being placed upon the capitals of
those which are situated towards the body of the church, and
carried up towards the vaulting.&nbsp; At each of the extreme
ends of the arcade a semi column is attached to the walls, to
complete the number necessary for sustaining the arches.&nbsp;
The main pillars and arches are ornamented with a simple ogee
moulding.&nbsp; The aisles are occupied by galleries that hide
the lower divisions of the windows, which are only seen
externally, no light being admitted below the galleries through
the outer walls.&nbsp; Between the clerestery windows and the
arcades below is the metzonine story, fronted by four cinque-foil
headed arches, and finished with a cornice of roses in enriched
quatre foils, designed as in imitation of the ancient
trifolium.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The eastern window does not fill up the entire wall as we find
in all ancient buildings, but a considerable portion of plain
masonry is left round it.&nbsp; The space below is occupied by a
splendid stone altar-screen of a beautiful antique design.&nbsp;
It consists of five upright divisions, formed by the buttresses,
the <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>central being the width of two of the others; they are
covered by ogee arches, with cinque foil sweeps in each, the
centre one having a canopy of the same sort, but more highly
enriched with a greater number of sweeps.&nbsp; From the canopies
rises a series of upright divisions, with trefoil heads; and
above is an entablature; the frieze of foliage in alto relievo;
the cornice of various mouldings, and the whole is fronted by
seven demi angels, in ancient costume, crowned; one hand of each
is placed on the breast, the other held up in the attitude of
benediction.&nbsp; The screen is flanked on each side by a
magnificent composition of niche work, ranging above two small
doorways leading to the vestry, the arches of which are obtuse,
and the architraves entirely formed of mouldings.&nbsp; Above the
point of the arch of each door case is an hexagonal canopy,
highly enriched, and supporting the pedestal of a large and
similarly formed niche above it, crowned with a like canopy,
which rises above the rest of the screen, and occupies a portion
of the wall on each side of the window.&nbsp; The pierced
stonework, elegant buttresses, and minute pinnacles of this
elegant composition, form an assemblage of architectural ornament
which would not disgrace any age in which the pointed style
prevailed; the scale of grandeur in which they are executed, and
the general tastefulness that marks the design, together with the
correct style of the elaborate details, would do honour to a
cathedral.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The centre division of the church is roofed with stone from
east to west.&nbsp; The style of vaulting is, however, full two
centuries earlier than the building: the nave of Westminster
Abbey seems to have been the prototype.&nbsp; That part of the
roof immediately above the altar is groined in a different
manner, the surface of the cove being filled with long panels
separated by arched ribs, springing from corbels, and crossing
the church from side to side; the same is repeated above the
organ; the corbels are all sculptured with figures of angels,
which at the altar are represented in the act of prayer, and over
the organ appear to be chanting the hymn of praise; though these
portions are well executed, the conceit of varying the design is
too novel to be admired.</p>
<p>From the groined roof depend three elegant brass chandeliers,
suspended on gilt chains.</p>
<p>The pulpit of wainscot is octangular, and stands on a frame
work of pointed arches; it is not wanting in ornament but it <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>falls short
of the ancient oak carvings.&nbsp; The reading desk, also of
wainscot, which is situated on the opposite side of the nave, is
similar in design.&nbsp; The fronts of the galleries are set off
with panelling, having cinque-foil heads; but wanting that
boldness of relief which distinguishes the ancient specimens of
carved wood work; to the altar chairs, the same remark
applies.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The font is situated in the centre aisle, near to the pulpit
and reading desk; it is of an octangular form, and sustained on a
pillar of the same shape.&nbsp; The different sides are panelled,
each containing a shield in an enriched quatrefoil, and the
pillar is ornamented with upright panels.&nbsp; It is executed in
marble, and the carving appears to be highly deserving of
praise.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Within the last few months there has been placed in the church
a lectern, which corresponds with the general character of the
edifice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The entire edifice is highly creditable to the parish, and may
be considered as a lasting monument to the memory of Mr. James
Savage, the architect.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The crypt or vaults under the church are well worthy of
inspection.&nbsp; They are conveniently approached, on the north
side, by a flight of steps, and are lofty, light, and thoroughly
ventilated.&nbsp; Here may be seen the foundation of the tower,
which is an inverted dome, and all the columns of the nave are
likewise built on and connected by inverted arches.&nbsp; No
doubt the construction of these numerous vaults added
considerably to the aggregate cost of the edifice, and when
interments were prohibited in the metropolitan parishes the
anticipated return was at once stopped, still they strengthen the
entire fabric, and ensure a freedom from damp, which is most
desirable.&nbsp; In several of these vaults are deposited the
remains of some of the most respected parishioners.</p>

<p>The church was consecrated on the 18th of October, 1824, and
as the foundation stone was laid on the 12th of October, 1820,
the building of the edifice occupied about four years.</p>
<h3>MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS IN THE CHURCH.</h3>
<p>There are many neat and well-designed marble tablets placed on
the walls in different parts of the church, and one monument in
particular which will be specially noticed.&nbsp; It would have
afforded me great satisfaction to have transcribed all the
tributes of affection there recorded, and also those in the
Burial Ground, but the limited nature of this work would only
admit of noticing a few of them.&nbsp; By adopting this course it
will enable me to refer to a variety of interesting subjects,
which otherwise in all probability must have been omitted.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>The
monument, to which allusion has just been made, commemorates a
hero who distinguished himself during the Peninsular
war:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">To the Memory of<br />
Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable Henry Cadogan,<br />
of his Majesty&rsquo;s 71st Regiment,<br />
who fell in the Battle of Vittoria, on June 1st, 1813,<br />
in the 33rd year of his age.<br />
The Officers of his Regiment have erected this Monument,<br />
In token of their esteem and regret.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This beautiful production of the chisel of Chantrey, which is
placed in the north gallery, represents two soldiers lamenting
the death of their heroic commander, whose portrait is on a
medallion surrounded with flags, with the Imperial eagle of
France underneath; the letter &ldquo;N.&rdquo; is on the top of
the pillar which supports the eagle.&nbsp; On the pedestal which
supports the sarcophagus is the word &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Vittoria</span>,&rdquo; encircled with a laurelled
crown; the sarcophagus is ornamented with a guilloche
moulding.&nbsp; Chastity of design and delicacy of execution are
the special characteristics of this admirable specimen of
art.&nbsp; There is another monument to the memory of this
gallant officer, erected at the public expense, in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and also a third in the Cathedral of
Glasgow.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>During the battle Colonel Cadogan had been detached to an
important position; and when it was discovered that he had been
mortally wounded, it was proposed to take him off the
field.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my death is now
certain, and very near; suffer me to conclude my life with the
pleasure of seeing the continuation of our triumph; carry me to
an height, from whence I can observe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
carried to one, when his back was placed against a tree, and
there he expired, after expressing his gratitude to those around
him.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There are inscriptions on marble tablets to the memory of the
following respected parishioners, amongst some others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>General Wilford, who resided for many years at
Ranelagh, departed this life in 1822, aged 69.</p>
<p>Mr. William Terwin, died Feb. 24, 1826, in the 74th year of
his age.&nbsp; Also, his brother, Mr. John Terwin, died Jan. 8,
1827, in his 69th year.</p>
<p>Joseph How, Esq., of Swan Walk, Paradise Row, (Queen&rsquo;s
Road West,) died in 1825, aged 72.&nbsp; He was much
respected.</p>
<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, widow of T. Smith, Esq., of No. 1, Manor
Terrace (now No. 167, King&rsquo;s Road), who, by will, in 1828,
bequeathed &pound;500 three per cent. consols, to be expended
annually as specified therein.</p>
<p>Thomas Bryan, Esq., of Cadogan Place, a magistrate for the
county, died in 1830, aged 66.&nbsp; He was much respected, and
was for some time treasurer of the Parochial Schools, and ever
ready to promote a charitable object.</p>
<p>G. H. Hopkinson, Esq., died in the year 1829, and Charles
Hopkinson, Esq., in 1830 (banker), resided in Cadogan Place for
many years.</p>
<p>R. E. N. Lee, Esq., resided for many years in Cheyne Walk, and
died in 1833.&nbsp; For 18 years he was Steward of the Manor.</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Richard Harmer, Esq., of Sloane Street, died in 1840,
aged 80 years.&nbsp; He was benevolent, and his death was much
deplored by many of the tradesmen in the locality.</p>
<p>The Rev. G. Clark, M.A., chaplain at the Royal Military
Asylum, a clergyman universally esteemed, died in 1848.</p>
<p>Peter Burrard, Esq., of Rayner Place, departed this life in
1842.&nbsp; He was a captain in Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Chelsea
Volunteers, served the office of churchwarden, and was greatly
esteemed by a large number of the parishioners.</p>
<p>Luke Thomas Flood, Esq., was a magistrate for the county, and
for a great number of years treasurer of the Parochial
Schools.&nbsp; There is a marble monument to his memory, near to
the vestry door, in the church, which is a fine specimen of the
sculptor&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; His munificent annual gifts to the
deserving and aged poor parishioners, however, is a memorial of
greater value than the most costly monument.&nbsp; He died at
Brighton, in 1860, at a very advanced age.</p>
<p>The Rev. Charles Kingsley, M.A., the late rector, and father
of the Rev. C. Kingsley, the popular author, died in 1860, aged
78.&nbsp; A notice of this kind-hearted clergyman is given in the
brief record of the Rectors of this church.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>COST OF BUILDING THE CHURCH, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>The original sum for the building of the Church, as agreed to
at a Public Vestry, held on the 20th of August, 1818, was not to
exceed in all &pound;30,000, including every other advance that
may be made from the Commissioners of Churches, and others.&nbsp;
The interest of this sum, together with the principal, was to be
paid out of a church rate, and the rate for this purpose was not
to exceed one shilling in the pound. <a name="citation137"></a><a
href="#footnote137" class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; From a
statement I possess, shewing the various amounts received and
paid by the Trustees for building the church, and including the
charges for constructing a sewer from it to the river Thames,
from the 21st of July, 1819, to the 27th of October, 1824, it
appears that the total sum expended to that period was
&pound;34,716 14s. 3d.&nbsp; This amount includes &pound;2,020
paid for the sewer, and &pound;3,595 <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>for interest on annuities, up to the
time of the above statement.&nbsp; The entire cost of building
the church, &amp;c., is generally estimated as being rather more
than &pound;40,000.&nbsp; It is calculated that it will very well
accommodate 2,000 persons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There was a petition signed against the New Church Bill, in
which it was acknowledged that there was a total inadequacy of
church accommodation in the parish&mdash;the population of which
the petitioners stated to be 20,000 souls&mdash;but they
submitted that &ldquo;it would be better to erect two chapels,
capable of holding 1,500 persons each, one to be situated at each
extremity of the parish, which might be done for one half the
church would cost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Anthony Todd Thomson, of
Sloane Street, who was one of the most able speakers in the
parish, most powerfully advocated the erection of two chapels,
but the opposition entirely failed.</p>
<h3>RECTORS AT THE NEW ST. LUKE&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>In the account of the Old Church a list of the Rectors
connected with that ancient edifice was given, we will now refer
to those since the completion of the new Parish Church.</p>
<p>The Hon. and Rev. G. V. Wellesley, D.D., who had been for many
years previously Rector, was a brother of the Duke of Wellington,
&ldquo;the great hero of many a hard-fought battle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Making a deduction for some slight difference in the corporeal
appearance of them, there was a great resemblance of features,
and in quickness of conception, correctness of judgment, and
general determination of character, there was an astonishing
similarity.&nbsp; Dr. Wellesley was quick in forming his
conclusions, and appeared at times to be somewhat hasty, but
generally it would be found that his views were founded on truth
and justice.&nbsp; This remark applies more especially to the
part he took as chairman of many of the &ldquo;open vestry&rdquo;
parish meetings, at which there was frequently much
contention.&nbsp; It was admitted, however, by those who were at
times opposed to his views that his conduct was impartial and
conciliatory, and the natural result was that he gained the
respect of all classes of the ratepayers, and thus allayed much
of that asperity of feeling which is too often manifested by
contending parties.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Dr.
Wellesley&rsquo;s appointment of the Rev. Henry Blunt, M.A., then
a young clergyman who had gained the esteem of a large portion of
the parishioners, as Morning Preacher and Senior Curate, gave
great satisfaction, and, as presently will be seen, shewed the
correct opinion he had entertained of Mr. Blunt&rsquo;s piety,
zeal, and qualifications to discharge the sacred duties he had so
wisely entrusted to him.&nbsp; Dr. Wellesley, after some years
had elapsed, resigned, and died at Bishopwearmouth, at an
advanced age.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Some few particulars respecting the Rev. H. Blunt may here be
very appropriately mentioned.&nbsp; The following opinion of him,
as a preacher, given by an avowed infidel, will convey a
tolerably good idea of his impressive manner of delivery.&nbsp; I
will give it as nearly as possible in the individual&rsquo;s own
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I went,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to your place
yesterday, (meaning the church,) and if ever I go again anywhere
it shall be to hear Mr. Blunt.&nbsp; I went in and meant to come
out shortly, but I had no sooner looked at him than his keen eyes
seemed fixed on mine, and as he appeared so sincere in what he
said, I remained till he had finished.&nbsp; He certainly was
most persuasive, and it spoilt my dinner.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
afterwards mentioned to Mr. Blunt, who smiled, and said, &ldquo;I
hope there were many others who went home to their dinners
equally impressed.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When Trinity Church, Sloane Street, was completed, the Rev.
Mr. Blunt became the Incumbent (the parish at that time was not
as at present divided into ecclesiastical divisions).&nbsp; Here
he was again greatly beloved by his large congregation, including
both rich and poor.&nbsp; Some years afterwards he accepted the
Rectory of Streatham, Surrey, where he at length died, as much
esteemed by the inhabitants there, as he had been previously at
Chelsea.&nbsp; Mr. Blunt was the chief founder of the first
Benevolent Society established in this parish, in 1829, entitled
the Chelsea Relief Association, and principally through his
exertions no less a sum than &pound;163 was collected within a
very short period.&nbsp; Hence arose other similar societies,
whose benevolent objects are well deserving of support.&nbsp; The
Infant School, in Markham Street, might be considered as Mr.
Blunt&rsquo;s cherished offspring, and the National Schools at
all times were regarded by him with feelings of deep regard.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Mr. Lockwood, M.A., succeeded the Hon. and Rev. Dr.
Wellesley, as rector, and manifested great interest in promoting
the welfare of the parish, but after a comparatively short period
he resigned.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>The
Rev. Charles Kingsley, M.A., next became Rector, and continued as
such for many years.&nbsp; He was but seldom absent from the
parish, and exhibited on all occasions a kind and benevolent
disposition.&nbsp; He died in the year 1860, aged 78.&nbsp; Mrs.
Kingsley was very active in establishing the Rectory Girls&rsquo;
School, and in promoting a variety of charities to aid the
poor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. G. A. Blunt, M.A., (son of the late Rev. H. Blunt,)
succeeded Mr. Kingsley, and is the present Rector.&nbsp; He has
evinced the greatest desire to promote the religious, moral, and
intellectual advancement of the working classes, and takes a deep
interest in promoting the Parochial National and Infant Schools,
&amp;c.&nbsp; There is one charitable society, of such a humane
and practical character, that it deserves to be specially
noticed.&nbsp; It is called &ldquo;The Sick Kitchen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In a printed &ldquo;Letter addressed to the Congregation and
Parishioners of St. Luke&rsquo;s, Chelsea,&rdquo; 1869, Mr. Blunt
states that it is &ldquo;carried on in a building erected for the
purpose in 1861, in the Rectory Garden.&nbsp; Its object is to
provide nutritious dinners for the poor who are recovering from
sickness.&nbsp; It is supported by voluntary contributions, the
early Communion alms, and half the contents of the church boxes
at St. Luke&rsquo;s.&nbsp; An average of thirty poor people are
thus supplied daily for nine months in the year.&nbsp; There is
no charge made, the orders being given by the Curates and
District Visitors, among the cases they visit.&nbsp; The dinners
consist of roast meat three times a week, soup, puddings,
&amp;c., on the alternate days; beef tea daily.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The advowson anciently belonged, as already stated, to the
Abbot and Convent of Westminster, till they exchanged it, 17th
July, 28 Henry VIII., together with their manors of Neyte and
Hyde, with the king, for the priory of Hurley.&nbsp; It continued
in the possession of the Crown till Queen Elizabeth, by letters
patent, dated July 3rd, second year of her reign, demised to Ann,
Duchess of Somerset, the advowson of the parish church and
rectory for her life, the reversion to the Queen.&nbsp; After the
death of the duchess it was granted to the Earl of Nottingham and
his Countess for three lives.&nbsp; King Charles I. granted the
advowson, with the manor, to James Duke of Hamilton, and in the
next reign Charles Cheyne, Esq., purchased the manor, to which
the rectory has ever since been annexed.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>In
the year 1327, 1st of Edward III., the rectory was rated at
thirteen marks, and in the king&rsquo;s books at &pound;13 6s.
8d., and the yearly tenths &pound;1 6s. 8d.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among Dr. King&rsquo;s original papers is the following
account of the rectory: &ldquo;The ancient parsonage-house, with
14 acres and 22 perches of land, stood west of the Duke of
Beaufort&rsquo;s, then the Marquis of Winchester&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
In lieu of which, upon an exchange, the present house, and land
about it, was given to the rectory for ever, by the consent of
the Queen, the then patron, Dr. Edmund Grindall, Bishop of
London, and Robt. Richardson, Rector of Chelsea, who conveyed the
old house and land to the Marquis by writing, bearing date May 3,
1566.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1650, it was reported to the Commissioners appointed by the
Parliament, that the parsonage-house of Chelsea, with twenty
acres of glebe, belonging to the same, were valued at &pound;60
per annum, and the tithes worth &pound;60 more.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rectory House, situated in Church Street, is very plain as
regards its exterior appearance.&nbsp; The grounds are enclosed
by a wall, and there are carriage entrances to the house.&nbsp;
The interior is commodious, but scarcely adequate to the
requirements of a large establishment in the present day.</p>
<h3>THE BURIAL GROUND, OR CEMETERY.</h3>
<p>In the south and north portions of the ground there are a
great number of memorial stones, and a few brick vaults.&nbsp;
That portion, situated at the north-eastern division, near to
Bond Street and Marlborough Square, the ground of which is raised
above the general surface, may be considered almost as one huge
grave, containing a mass of interments.&nbsp; It was originally
called &ldquo;The Poor Ground,&rdquo; on account of its being
devoted exclusively for those who were buried at the expense of
the parish.&nbsp; It would display much good feeling and
sympathy, if some simple but appropriate record was placed
there.&nbsp; It might be done by subscription, should there be no
funds available for such a purpose.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With respect to the numerous inscriptions, it would be
impossible, as already stated, to notice more than a very few of
<a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>them,
and they contain generally only the name and age of the person
interred.&nbsp; And, after all, we may say with the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The best concerted schemes men lay for
fame,<br />
Die fast away; only themselves die faster.<br />
The far-famed sculptor and the laurelled bard,<br />
Those bold insurancers of deathless fame,<br />
Supply their little feeble aids in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Blair&rsquo;s
Grave</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Jones, Esq., aged 83, resided in Manor Street, Cheyne
Walk.&nbsp; He was a good Hebrew and Greek scholar, but it is in
the character of a naturalist that he must be principally
regarded, Mr. Jones having painted from nature about 1,500
species of butterflies in a most masterly manner, and not only
painted but arranged and characterized them in Latin.</p>
<p>Matthew Yatman, Esq., of Lindsey Row, died in 1814; he was a
most accomplished gentleman.</p>
<p>Signor Carlo Rovedino, an Italian, died in this parish Oct. 6,
1822, aged 71; he was well known on the continent and in this
country as a bass singer.</p>
<p>Thomas Raven, a pupil in St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, died in
his sleep in 1826, aged 20.</p>
<p>Dr. John M&lsquo;Leod, the companion of Sir Murray Maxwell,
and the author of a voyage in H.M. ship &ldquo;Alceste,&rdquo; to
the Yellow Sea, and of her shipwreck in the Straits of Gaspar; he
died in the King&rsquo;s Road in 1820, aged 38.</p>
<p>Thomas Davey, Esq., of the King&rsquo;s Road, died in 1833; he
was a celebrated florist, and resided opposite Royal Avenue
Terrace.&nbsp; This gentleman served most of the old parochial
offices, and his general good-natured disposition gained for him
the respect of all parties in the parish.</p>
<p>William Tebbs, Esq. died in 1831, aged 59; he was beloved by a
large circle of friends, and esteemed by all who knew him.</p>

<p>Most of the old and respected parishioners of Chelsea, who
once occupied a prominent position in it, have passed away from
the scenes of this world, to enjoy, it is hoped, that pure and
unalloyed happiness which can only be realized in that kingdom
where there is neither poverty, anxiety, sorrow, or pain.&nbsp;
Some of them no doubt are interred in this ground, but it would
have displayed partiality to have noticed some and emitted
others.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>From
an official statement, dated Dec. 22, 1823, shewing the receipts
and disbursements under each head, from the incorporation of the
Burial Ground Trustees, April 10, to September 1823, it appears
that the whole amount of expenditure, during the above period,
was &pound;17,243 8s. 6d.&nbsp; This amount included &pound;4,713
1s. 0&frac14;d., for enclosing the ground, and &pound;1,135 5s.
7&frac12;d., for building the temporary chapel, which was erected
at the northern entrance, for reading the Funeral Service,
previously to the erection of the Church.</p>

<p>In concluding the account of St. Luke&rsquo;s Church, and
Burial Ground, I venture to insert, at the request of some
subscribers to this work, the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<h3>REMINISCENCES OF ST. LUKE&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Whene&rsquo;er I view that beauteous tower,<br
/>
Built with artistic taste and power<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon yon sacred sod,<br />
My heart awakes, with thankful strain,<br />
For in old age I see again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That temple of my God.</p>
<p class="poetry">Once in that Church I bent the knee,<br />
And join&rsquo;d the holy minstrelsy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That lifts the soul above:&mdash;<br />
The powerful organ swell&rsquo;d on high,<br />
And many felt that God was nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspir&rsquo;d by faith and love.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve seen there a bride, in rich
attire,<br />
Receive the ring from her loving sire,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sign the marriage book:&mdash;<br />
Then when they left the bells were rung,<br />
And the porch fill&rsquo;d with old and young,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see their happy look.</p>
<p class="poetry">I&rsquo;ve stood beside the baptismal font,<br
/>
Where children oft to Christ were brought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And th&rsquo; cross mark&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er their
brow:&mdash;<br />
And it was a joyful after-sight<br />
To see them, in emblematic white,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirm their sponsor&rsquo;s vow.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>The preacher, by his earnest way,<br />
Fill&rsquo;d the Church on the Sabbath day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And touch&rsquo;d their hearts within:&mdash;<br />
He told them of the bleating sheep, <a name="citation144"></a><a
href="#footnote144" class="citation">[144]</a><br />
Of Saul&rsquo;s deceit, and crime so deep,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And warn&rsquo;d them of his sin.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there have aged pilgrims stood,<br />
(Now safely pass&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er Jordan&rsquo;s flood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gain&rsquo;d blest Canaan&rsquo;s shore,)<br />
Each burthen there they seem&rsquo;d to cast,<br />
As if each danger they had pass&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all their toil was o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p class="poetry">And last I&rsquo;ve seen the funeral train,<br
/>
Like mourners on a desert plain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come slowly with their load:&mdash;<br />
I&rsquo;ve stood beside the silent bier,<br />
And watch&rsquo;d the trickling kindred tear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fall in death&rsquo;s drear abode.</p>
<p class="poetry">Oh! when I view that sacred tower,<br />
At morning or at evening hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By pure devotion led,<br />
I love to meditate awhile&mdash;<br />
I think I see some angels smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the peaceful dead!</p>

<h3>PARISH REGISTERS.</h3>
<p>We now come to an exceedingly interesting subject, interesting
alike, both to old and young, when we consider the very small
population of the parish three centuries back compared with the
present time now numbering about 70,000.&nbsp; Many of the early
records of Parish Registers, will be found often written in so
quaint a style as to be almost amusing, still they carry with
them solemn thoughts, if rightly regarded, which ought to produce
a salutary effect.&nbsp; When we read, too, the inscriptions on
the monuments in our cathedrals, old churches, and in our
cemeteries, and find ourselves actually walking over the remains
<a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of
noblemen, statesmen, and others&mdash;some celebrated for their
noble and gallant conduct, or for hospitality and munificence,
and many for their devotion to the study of theology, literature,
the fine arts, &amp;c.&mdash;we become, as it were, rivetted to
the sacred spot, and whatever pleasing historical associations
may occur to the mind, they are involuntarily mingled with
reflections of a far more solemn character.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first institution of Parish Registers in England commenced
in 1501, 16th of Henry VIII., although the keeping of them was
not strictly enjoined till the injunction of Lord Cromwell, 30th
of Henry VIII., but he being considered as a favourer of
innovations in religion, the good intent of them was much
misrepresented, and his order rarely attended to by the
clergy.&nbsp; A second order of this kind was issued in the
second year of Edward VI., 1547, though perhaps little complied
with.&nbsp; A third order is found in the statutes of the
National Synod, by Cardinal Pole, about 1555, and the last and
most successful in the 1st, 7th, and 39th years of Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first Chelsea Parish Register Book is a small folio,
vellum, a great part of which is beautifully written.&nbsp; It
commences with the year 1559, and appears to be accurately kept,
except that it is imperfect during the Interregnum; and there are
some omissions in the burials between 1564 and 1591, and between
1644 and 1652, the year in which it ends.&nbsp; In the first leaf
there is this memorandum: &ldquo;A Booke begun in the House of
God for Regestringe of all Christenings, Marages, and Burialls
within the Parishe of Chelsey, provided for that purpose by J.
Tomkins and Thomas Saunders, Church Wardens, the 19 daye of
Feburarie 1559, and new in the time and yeare of Richard Warde,
Parson of Chelsey, 11 March, 1599.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the population increased the records of the parish
naturally became more voluminous, and for many years past the
proceedings of the vestrymen, and also of the Board of Guardians,
are kept in the most admirable manner.&nbsp; This, it is true, is
the effect of the improved state of society, the passing of the
Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and the introduction of
better Laws for the relief and maintenance of the poor.</p>
<h3><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>THE
PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS.</h3>
<p>These schools are situated at the east side of the
Cemetery.&nbsp; The pointed style was adopted on account of the
contiguity of the building to the Parish Church.&nbsp; It
consists of a centre, with low wings.&nbsp; The wings are
occupied by the schools, and the centre as residences intended
for the master and mistress; a large pointed arch connects the
two divisions.&nbsp; The first stone was laid on the 18th of
June, 1824, by the Hon. and Rev. Dr. Wellesley, rector, with the
customary formalities, at which there were present the late Rev.
Henry Blunt, and several other clergymen, besides a vast number
of the parishioners, including many ladies.&nbsp; In 1826 the
entire building was finished, and the children were admitted.</p>
<h3>CHELSEA WORKHOUSE.</h3>
<p>Before the year 1723 there were no workhouses in
England.&nbsp; It was the custom to relieve the able-bodied at
their own dwelling places, and the aged and infirm were, in many
cases, supported by the alms given at the church.&nbsp; In 1727,
it was &ldquo;agreed that the churchwardens should be empowered
to take, with all convenient speed, a proper house upon lease, in
the name of the parish, for the use of the poor.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1733 it was resolved, at a vestry, &ldquo;That a committee be
appointed to find out the most proper method to procure a
workhouse for the poor, and an additional burial
ground.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result was that Sir Hans Sloane gave the
present ground for both purposes, and the first erection of the
workhouse took place about 1737.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The building, at the early part of this century, contained but
few dwelling rooms, besides those occupied by the master and
mistress.&nbsp; It had two wings, however, the one to the
south-west was built in 1792, and the south-east wing in
1797.&nbsp; The whole did not occupy much space.&nbsp; There was
a garden, tastefully laid out, with a neat box-edging around each
compartment. <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a>&nbsp; An aged inmate was the gardener,
and he took great delight in <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>keeping it in good order.&nbsp; How
altered is now the appearance of the workhouse!&nbsp; The pretty
garden, where once I plucked a flower, has long since
disappeared, and on its site are erected extensive buildings, to
afford necessary accommodation for the vast increase of
inmates.&nbsp; Since the period to which I first alluded many
additions have been made to the original workhouse, and
consequently it was altogether devoid of uniformity; but as it
has been within the last few years almost rebuilt, under the
direction of G. Handford, Esq., architect and surveyor, of the
King&rsquo;s Road, the defect mentioned is no longer
apparent.&nbsp; Indeed, unless it had been an entire new
erection, no further improvement, as regards the exterior, could
have been made.&nbsp; The interior is well arranged, both for
comfort and convenience.&nbsp; There are at the present time
upwards of 560 inmates, and the Guardians afford every reasonable
indulgence to the aged and deserving amongst them.&nbsp; Thomas
Symons, Esq., the Chairman of the Board, is highly esteemed by
the parishioners, and they have recently presented to him a very
handsome testimonial of respect.</p>
<h3>THE KING&rsquo;S ROAD CEMETERY.</h3>
<p>This cemetery adjoins the workhouse, and the ground was the
gift of Sir Hans Sloane.&nbsp; It was consecrated in 1736, by
Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London.&nbsp; In 1790 it was enlarged by
a grant from Lord Cadogan.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The obelisk, near the centre, was erected to the memory of
Andrew Millar, an eminent bookseller in London, who died in 1768,
aged 61 years; he had little pretensions to learning, but
possessed a very nice discrimination in selecting his literary
counsellors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On a flat stone, on the north side, is an inscription in
memory of John Martyn, F.R.S., Professor of Botany at Cambridge,
and Eulalia, his wife, youngest daughter of the Rev. Dr. King,
rector.&nbsp; She died in 1748&ndash;9, and Mr. Martyn in
1768.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Baptist Cipriani, the celebrated artist, and one of the
earliest members of the Royal Academy, was interred in this
burial ground.&nbsp; On the north side is a tomb to his
memory.&nbsp; <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Cipriani excelled in delineating the human figure, and
was much employed by the printsellers in making drawings, which
are well known by Bartolozzi&rsquo;s beautiful engravings from
them; he died in 1785, aged 58.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Philip Withers, D.D., July 1790.&nbsp; In 1779 he
published proposals for a splendid edition of the Table of Cebes,
with plates and notes, intended for the benefit of the Sons of
the Clergy, but owing to some misunderstanding with Archbishop
Cornwallis, the work never appeared; he lived in Sloane Square in
1789, and imprudently published several libellous pamphlets, for
which he was convicted.&nbsp; He was committed to Newgate for
twelve months, fined &pound;50, and died there of a fever.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Sloane Ellesmere, rector, was buried here in 1766; and
Lady Rous, aged 90, widow of Sir W. Rous, Alderman of London, in
1777.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Hannah Aston and Anne Aston, two sisters, died in 1806.&nbsp;
These unfortunate young women were daughters of Mr. Aston, of
Robinson&rsquo;s Lane (now Flood Street), and had been with a
party to Richmond.&nbsp; On their return the boat struck on a
barge near Putney Bridge, by which accident they were both
drowned, together with Mr. Isaac Van Butchell, son of the
eccentric Dr. Van Butchell.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this ground is the family vault of the Rev. Weeden Butler,
whom we have noticed amongst the residents in Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. John Fraser, nurseryman, who resided many years in the
King&rsquo;s Road, close to Sloane Square; he was ardently
attached to botanical researches, and several times explored the
wilds of North America; he died in 1811.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, of the King&rsquo;s Road, died in 1828,
in the 49th year of her age, after a short but severe
illness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There have been but few interments in this burial ground for
many years.&nbsp; When the new St. Luke&rsquo;s cemetery was
completed, in 1812, this ground was closed, excepting to those
who had relatives previously buried in it.&nbsp; The population
of the parish, from the year just mentioned, rapidly increased,
and the burials, about 1832, amounted in the year to upwards of
600, but many of these belonged to the adjoining parishes, and a
large proportion were children.</p>
<h3><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
King&rsquo;s Road:<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ITS ORIGIN, EARLY CONDITION, AND PRESENT
STATE.</span></h3>
<p>As this road is the central great thoroughfare through
Chelsea, some early particulars respecting it cannot be otherwise
than interesting.&nbsp; It was originally only a footway through
the fields, for the use of the farmers and gardeners to get
access to their lands; but soon after the restoration of Charles
II. it was found a convenient way for his Majesty to go to
Hampton Court Palace, and thus it was, after some discussion
between the Government and the parishioners of Chelsea, converted
into a coach road.&nbsp; The following extracts from the petition
of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart., Lord of the Manor, and other
freeholders, will give a sufficient detail of its history and
origin, and from which it appears that disputes had arisen
concerning the right of way; and after the claims of the
inhabitants had been considered by the Lords Commissioners of his
Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, the matter was finally decided in their
favour in the year 1719, the 5th of George I.:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To
the Rt. Hon. the Lords of His Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury</span>,
&amp;c. <a name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a"
class="citation">[153a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;That before the restoration of King Charles the Second,
and some time after, the fields of Chelsea were open fields; and
that the bridge, called Bloody Bridge, <a
name="citation153b"></a><a href="#footnote153b"
class="citation">[153b]</a> was only a foot-bridge, with a plank
or board; and the way leading thence to the lane facing Blackland
House, <a name="citation153c"></a><a href="#footnote153c"
class="citation">[153c]</a> was then only a foot-path of about
five feet wide, and the lands on each side were plowed and sowed
close up to the same; and that from the said lane to the town
gate was only a baulk, or head land, of about ten or twelve feet
broad, or thereabouts; and the lands on each side of the said
head-lands were also ploughed up to the edges thereof; <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>and that
the said head-land was used by the owners and occupiers of the
said lands for a way, egress and regress, to their lands, with
ploughs and other utensils of husbandry, and to carry off their
crops from their lands, time out of mind.&nbsp; That some time
after the restoration, King Charles II. built Bloody Bridge, as
it now stands; and, as we are informed, agreed with the then Lord
of the Manor, and others concerned, for the said head-land, for
his Majesty&rsquo;s private road, allowing the freeholders their
ancient way through the same.&nbsp; Whereupon the king made the
road with gravel, and the landowners ditched out their lands on
each side of the same; and the king took upon him the repair of
the gate at the town end (which before was maintained by the
parishioners), and as soon as the fields were sown, was hung up
and shut, and, after harvest, was always open until seed time
returned again, as many yet alive well remember.&nbsp; And ever
since the landholders of the said parish have been in possession
of a free way and passage to their lands through the said road,
(some persons having no other way,) and were never denied it
during the reigns of King Charles the Second, King James, King
William, and Queen Anne, as we can make appear by sufficient
evidence.&nbsp; Now, whereas, upon his present Majesty&rsquo;s
repairing the said road, the present Surveyor-General has given
orders to shut the gates against the landholders of Chelsea, to
their great detriment, and, as we conceive, to the debarring them
of their right.&nbsp; We humbly beg your Lordships will take the
matter into your consideration, hear our evidence, and grant us
such relief as, in your great wisdom, you shall think fit.&nbsp;
That the late Duchess Dowager of Beaufort (to whose stables and
offices there is no other way), about five or six years ago,
ordered her stewards and servants to cut down a turnpike, which
Mr. Manly, the Surveyor-General, had set up between the walls at
the corner, next Church Lane (Street); and they carried the posts
away, being set up, as she said, upon her ground.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this petition was attached the evidence of several of the
freeholders, in confirmation of what was stated in the above
petition.&nbsp; One of these was given by Mr. Matthew Hutchins,
gardener, of the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above petition was referred to Hugh Cholmley, Esq.,
Surveyor-General, and William Watkins, Esq., Surveyor of his
Majesty&rsquo;s private roads.&nbsp; The reports from these two
official gentlemen were evasive and unsatisfactory, and
consequently a second statement was sent to the Commissioners, in
reply to <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>the objections.&nbsp; This last statement from Sir Hans
Sloane was dated May 6, 1719.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the same day (May 6) the following letter was
received:&mdash;&ldquo;My Lords direct Mr. Watkins to permit the
tenants of the lands adjoining to the King&rsquo;s Road, through
Chelsea, to have free passage through the same, with their carts
and horses, in the manner they have been accustomed to; and that
the ditches which belong to the land, and lately filled up, be
opened again.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above particulars explain the origin of placing the gates,
or bars, at different parts of the King&rsquo;s Road, and which
many of the parishioners at the present time well remember.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Daring robberies and murders appear to have been very frequent
about this period, especially in the Five Fields, (now Eaton
Square, &amp;c.) and along the whole line of the King&rsquo;s
Private Road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Timbs, F.S.A., says, &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s Road, near
the spot where is now the Vestry Hall, the Earl of Peterborough
was stopped by highwaymen in what was then a narrow lane; and the
robbers, being watched by some soldiers, who formed a part of the
guard at Chelsea College, were fired at from behind the hedge;
one of these highwaymen turned out to be a student in the Temple,
whose father having lost his estate, his son lived by
&lsquo;play, sharping, and a little on the highway,&rsquo; the
desperate resources of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In September, 1753, a Mr. Crouch, cook to the Earl of
Harrington, was attacked at night by two men who took his watch
and money, and then stabbed him with a knife and beat him till he
died. <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following most diabolical and remarkable case of burglary
and murder occurred in the King&rsquo;s Road in 1771:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>On
the site of the King&rsquo;s Parade (near to Oakley Square) stood
an ancient farm, which was in the occupation of the family of
Mrs. Hutchins for many years.&nbsp; She was a widow, and some
Jews it appeared made inquiries as to her circumstances, and
considering there was a chance of obtaining valuable booty,
determined on robbing the house.&nbsp; In June, 1771, they
sauntered about the fields till 10 o&rsquo;clock at night, and
then went and knocked at the door, which was opened by a female
servant, when immediately eight Jews entered the house.&nbsp;
They seized the girl and treated her with great severity.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hutchins went to her servant&rsquo;s assistance, but one of
them, Levi Weil, called Dr. Weil, compelled her to sit in a
chair, after which he threw part of her clothes over her head to
prevent her seeing their faces, and threatened to murder her if
she made any resistance.&nbsp; They then went up stairs to a
room, where Joseph Slow and William Stone, two men servants, were
in bed, and in a sound sleep.&nbsp; Dr. Weil gave Stone a violent
blow on the breast, when Slow instantly started up, on which the
others cried out &ldquo;Shoot him!&rdquo; and a pistol was fired,
the ball from which entered the body of Slow, who exclaimed,
&ldquo;Lord have mercy upon me!&nbsp; I am murdered!&nbsp; I am
murdered!&rdquo;&nbsp; They then dragged him to the stairs,
which, being observed by Stone, he made his escape out of the
window.&nbsp; They then robbed the house, and demanded money of
Mrs. Hutchins, one of them struck her violently, and threatened
to kill her.&nbsp; She was compelled at length to give her watch
and 64 guineas, after which they quitted the house.&nbsp; Mrs.
Hutchins then went to see her servants.&nbsp; She found the two
maid-servants bound together; and no sooner had she given them
their liberty than the wounded man said, &ldquo;How are you,
madam, for I am dying.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words were scarcely
uttered, when he fell down on the floor, and having suffered the
most excruciating pain, expired on the following day, leaving a
wife and two children to lament his loss.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The robbery and murder was no sooner known than a reward was
offered from the Secretary of State&rsquo;s office, for the
apprehension of the gang.&nbsp; The offer was seconded by that of
a much larger reward from the City of London; and also another of
&pound;50 from the parishioners of Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The murderers, however, remained undiscoverd for a
considerable time till Daniel Isaacs, one of the gang, became the
means of discovering his accomplices, in the following
manner:&mdash;Isaacs, being touched with remorse of conscience,
&amp;c., sent for a friend <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>and acknowledged himself to be one
of the nine men concerned in the robbery and murder at Mrs.
Hutchins&rsquo;s, at Chelsea.&nbsp; He desired his friend to
inform some magistrate of it; and having told him the names and
places of abode of his accomplices, his friend went immediately
to Sir John Fielding, at Bow Street, who sent the officers after
them, by which means seven of them were taken.&nbsp; The cause of
this confession and remorse of conduct, on the part of Isaacs,
was distress.&nbsp; He applied for relief to the elders of the
Jewish synagogue, but the treasurer refused him any immediate
assistance, urging as a reason that he should not have left his
native country, Holland, where he might have obtained probably an
honest living.&nbsp; At that time a great number of Jews came to
this country, and a selection of cases could only be
relieved.&nbsp; Isaacs, in consequence of the refusal, became
greatly distressed, and, in order to gain the reward, offered by
the City of London, made the above confession.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Isaacs was admitted to give evidence against his accomplices,
six of whom were soon apprehended, but the other made his
escape.&nbsp; There appears to have been some discrepancy as
regards the number of the gang, one account states eight, while
another mentions nine.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the Old Bailey Sessions, in December, 1771, Levi Weil,
Asher Weil, Marcus Hartogh, Jacob Lazarus, Solomon Porter, Hyam
Lazarus, and Abraham Linewill, (the man who had absconded) were
indicted for the robbery and murder, when the two of the name of
Weil, with Jacob Lazarus and Solomon Porter, were capitally
convicted, and Marcus Hartogh and Hyam Lazarus were
acquitted.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. Hutchins deposed on the trial, that about six weeks
before her house was robbed, Hyam Lazarus came to it, inquiring
for one Beetham, a weaver, when she said she knew no such person;
that on the 11th of June, the night of the robbery she heard the
dog bark, about ten o&rsquo;clock at night, her men being then
gone to bed; that she called to one of her two maid-servants to
see what was the matter with the dog, and shortly after, hearing
a noise, she ran herself to see, and found her maid, Mary
Hodgkin, with her cap off, and some men using her extremely ill;
that to the best of her remembrance, she recollected Levi Weil
and Hyam Lazarus to be among these men; and though her fright was
exceedingly great, she did her endeavour to assist her maid, but
that Levi Weil (called the Doctor,) pushed her into a chair, and
pulled her upper petticoat <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>over her face, which hindered her
seeing any of the rest.&nbsp; Hearing her cook cry very much, one
of them said, &ldquo;Cut her throat;&rdquo; another, &ldquo;If
you don&rsquo;t hold your tongue, I will cut your
throat.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then coming to her (Mrs. Hutchins) they
offered to tie her legs, and she begged they would not, as she
would not stir; whereupon they all went to another room, the door
of which being locked, they said they would break it, if not
immediately opened, and returned from it in about five minutes;
that then going up stairs, she shortly after heard somebody cry
&ldquo;fire!&rdquo; and after much swearing, heard also a pistol
go off, and a man cried out, and begged they would not; that,
endeavouring to get out at the back door, she was prevented by
some men on the outside, who told her if they were not her
friends they would blow her brains out; that then returning to
her chair, she heard a very great noise above stairs, as if they
were throwing the servant down, and a little while after she
heard another pistol go off; that the wounded man, endeavouring
to get down, came to her, and said, &ldquo;How are you
ma&rsquo;am, for I am a dead man;&rdquo; on which, turning short,
he fell on the ground; that his shirt was on fire close to the
wound just under the shoulder, which she put out, that he groaned
very much, and complained of being cold; that the people in the
house, running from room to room, came down to her, and Levi
Weil, to the best of her knowledge, took the buckles out of her
shoes, and two others attempted to put their hands into her
pockets; she begged they would not, saying she would give them
something worth their acceptance, and accordingly gave them her
purse and watch; that asking where her plate was, she told them,
and they took it out of the cupboard, and gave it to their
companions at the back door.&nbsp; That going into the parlour,
where there was a cupboard, they broke it open; and she
following, told them there was nothing in it worth having but
paper; but that one of them, a short, thick, elderly man, struck
her on the face with a pistol, and would have shot her, had not
the Doctor turned the pistol with his hand.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Recorder prefaced the sentence with a judicious and just
compliment to the principal Jews, for their very laudable conduct
in the course of the prosecution, and hoped no person would
stigmatize a whole nation for the villanies of a few.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>These men, as was customary formerly in cases of murder, were
tried on a Friday, and on the following day (the Jewish Sabbath)
they were anathematized in the Synagogue.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>As
their execution was to take place on the following Monday, one of
the Rabbies went to them in the press-room of Newgate, and
delivered to each of them a Hebrew book, but declined attending
them to the place of death, nor even prayed with them, at the
time of his visit.&nbsp; Their wives and children were admitted
to take their leave of them before they set out for Tyburn, where
executions took place. <a name="citation159"></a><a
href="#footnote159" class="citation">[159]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>An immense number of people attended the execution.&nbsp; They
prayed together, sung an hymn in the Hebrew language, and soon
afterwards were launched into eternity.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following anecdote, in reference to this daring robbery,
was very frequently related many years ago, and I do not remember
that its veracity was ever questioned.&nbsp; Soon after the
conviction of the Jews, the Queen paid a visit to Mrs. Hutchins,
and, after expressing the deepest sympathy for her sufferings,
desired to be informed whether she could advance the interests of
any member of the family.&nbsp; A circumstance was mentioned to
her Majesty, which resulted in one of the junior branches being
ultimately educated at one of the Universities.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We will now briefly notice the King&rsquo;s Road, as it was at
the earlier part of the present century.&nbsp; At the entrance
into Chelsea parish, at the eastern end of Sloane Square, the
bridge, to which we have several times referred, was at that
period probably about 14 or 16ft. wide, on both sides of which
there was a wall of sufficient height to protect passengers from
falling into the narrow rivulet which it spanned, and which
belonged to the commissioners of sewers.&nbsp; There were two
little cottages near to this stream, and immediately contiguous
to them was Mr. Burgess&rsquo;s premises, who carried on a very
good business, as a coach builder, &amp;c.&nbsp; The houses
around Sloane Square were nearly the same as they are at the
present time, but the square was an open space, simply enclosed
by wooden posts, connected by iron chains, where boys frequently
played at cricket, &amp;c.&nbsp; Here, too, Queen
Charlotte&rsquo;s Royal Volunteers often assembled, and marched
off in military order to Hyde Park, accompanied by an excellent
band.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>In
1812 the Chelsea and Brompton Dispensary was established in
Sloane Square, principally through the great exertions of the
Rev. George Clark, M.A., the then chaplain of the Royal Military
Asylum.&nbsp; At the meeting convened for that purpose, the late
W. Wilberforce, Esq., M.P., presided, whose name will be ever
associated with the abolition of slavery, and as the advocate of
almost every humane society in this country.&nbsp; This admirable
institution indicates the rapid growth of the population.&nbsp;
The earliest annual average of patients did not exceed 1200, in
1860 it was upwards of 6000, and since the last date the number
has greatly increased.&nbsp; The first physicians were Dr.
Ainsley and Dr. Adam Black, and its first surgeons Robert Smith
and Anthony Todd Thomson, Esqrs.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Fraser&rsquo;s Botanical Grounds adjoined Sloane
Square.&nbsp; He explored distant parts of the world several
times, so ardently attached was he to botanical researches.&nbsp;
He was patronized by a large number of the nobility and
gentry.&nbsp; His death took place, in 1811, at his
residence.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It will be seen shortly that if the King&rsquo;s Road, in the
&ldquo;Olden Times,&rdquo; was almost exclusively occupied by
farmers and gardeners, that, for a number of years afterwards,
one of the principal attractions to it was the many celebrated
nursery and floricultural grounds.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The high wall at the Royal Military Asylum, which formed the
back of the boys&rsquo; lavatory, &amp;c., and which stood more
forward than the present enclosure, had no pathway whatever
against it, and the road being at one part very narrow, it was
not only inconvenient but at times dangerous.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Colvill&rsquo;s Nursery Ground stood on the site of
Colvill Terrace, and the entrance to it was at the eastern
corner.&nbsp; His display of flowers excited general admiration,
and consequently an immense number of the gentry generally paid
him a daily visit during the summer season..&nbsp; The grounds,
however, were only enclosed with an old wooden fence, and here
again there was no footway for passengers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Thomas Davey was also a celebrated florist, and his ground
was opposite what was called the White Stiles, now known as the
Royal Avenue to Chelsea College.&nbsp; The origin of the former
name arose from there being an ornamental stile at the
entrances.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>The
grounds of Mr. Colvill were detached from those of Mr. Davey by a
footpath, on both sides of which there were neatly-trimmed
hedges, and as butterflies abound in floricultural gardens, this
passage was called &ldquo;Butterfly Alley.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
houses have since been built on this site, and, although the road
is narrow, it now assumes the name of Keppel Street, connecting
the King&rsquo;s Road with the Fulham Road.&nbsp; Opposite the
above-named alley there was a bar placed across the road, to
prevent waggons, &amp;c., from passing unless the driver produced
proof that he was going to some resident in it.&nbsp; The origin
of these bars has just been fully detailed.</p>
<p>Mr. Pratt, a friend of Mr. Faulkner, wrote the following
lines, &ldquo;Flowers and Fashion,&rdquo; in reference to the
above two celebrated floricultural grounds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Where smiling Chelsea spreads the cultur&rsquo;d
lands,<br />
Sacred to Flora a pavilion stands,<br />
And yet a second temple neighb&rsquo;ring near<br />
Nurses the fragrance of the various year;<br />
Of Davey this, of Colvill that, the care,<br />
While both the favour of the goddess share.<br />
But not for her&mdash;the deity of flowers&mdash;<br />
<i>Alone</i> the incense breathes, still higher Powers:&mdash;<br
/>
Fair Venus marks each temple for her own,<br />
And <span class="smcap">Fashion</span> sits upon a
blossom&rsquo;d throne.<br />
She, pow&rsquo;r supreme! bids vanquish&rsquo;d Flora kneel,<br
/>
And drags proud Beauty at her chariot wheel.<br />
The Cyprian Queen asserts her loftier sway,<br />
And blushing rivals with a smile obey.<br />
At Fashion&rsquo;s shrine unnumber&rsquo;d suppliants bow,<br />
And to their idol chaunt the sacred vow.<br />
A thousand Eves, each as their mother fair,<br />
To these gay Edens every hour repair:<br />
And though the wreaths boast but a fleeting bloom,<br />
And often press at eve a twilight tomb,<br />
Still, as by magic, we behold each morn<br />
A fresh supply the pillag&rsquo;d scenes adorn;<br />
And though the lovely plunderers bear away<br />
The fairy sweets that open&rsquo;d with the day;<br />
Though one fair Paradise is lost each night,<br />
Another blooms with the returning light.<br />
Thus, strange to tell! near London you behold<br />
The age of <span class="smcap">Fashion</span>, <span
class="smcap">Beauty</span>, and of <span
class="smcap">Gold</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old White Hart public-house and tea-gardens, situated on
the opposite side of the road to Mr. Davey&rsquo;s grounds, was
<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>a rather
ancient-looking place of resort.&nbsp; It was well-conducted, and
occasionally a great many persons visited it.&nbsp; On its site
is now a very respectable tavern.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near to this house, a little to the east, about 1818, a poor
man was sitting by the roadside, apparently in the most pitiable
state of hunger and destitution.&nbsp; A pensioner belonging to
Chelsea Hospital, a man of colour, was passing along at the time
with a can of soup and a small loaf of bread, which he had just
previously received as his dinner allowance, some of the men
being allowed to have private lodgings.&nbsp; The pensioner gazed
for a moment at the wretched object of misery, and then, with a
heart full of sympathy, gave him some of the soup and
bread.&nbsp; Such an act of benevolence excited the attention of
a very young man, who, whenever he met the kind-hearted black
pensioner, always felt a feeling of respect for him.&nbsp; Some
time afterwards it came to the knowledge of this youth that the
pensioner had been convicted of a certain crime, not now a
capital offence, and sentenced to be executed.&nbsp; This
communication very much surprised him, but he could not erase
from his memory the humane conduct he had witnessed.&nbsp;
Accordingly, he went to Newgate on the following day, unknown to
his friends, to see the condemned malefactor.&nbsp; On his
arrival at the prison the turnkey at the entrance door refused
him admittance, and told him, in a gruff manner, that he must get
an order.&nbsp; He then went direct to the Sheriff&rsquo;s
residence, and, after some conversation, obtained a special order
for admission.&nbsp; The turnkey now became very respectful, and
the young man was immediately conducted to the yard where the
condemned prisoners took the benefit of the fresh air.&nbsp; The
aged convict&rsquo;s appearance was much altered, and during
nearly the whole time of the visit tears rolled down his
cheeks.&nbsp; He was thus visited several times, and, at length,
through a petition presented by the authorities at Chelsea
Hospital, and another from some of the parishioners, the unhappy
black man&rsquo;s sentence was mitigated to transportation for
life.&nbsp; At one of the interviews, the culprit asked for some
memorial of the young man&rsquo;s kindness, having been
previously told that his life would be spared, and a Bible was
given to him, with the name of the youthful donor written in
it.&nbsp; An assurance was given that he would see him again that
week, but when the young man went the poor black pensioner had
been removed from the prison, and he never heard of him
afterwards.&nbsp; The evidence produced at the trial fully
justified the verdict of being guilty of the charge, but there
was gross culpability on the part of the prosecutrix.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>A
little beyond the old White Hart tea gardens, to the west, on the
same side of the road, was the residence of the elder Mr.
Downing.&nbsp; It stood in a neatly laid out garden, and
resembled very much in appearance one of those old but
comfortable retreats which may still be seen by the roadside in
some parts of the country.&nbsp; Adjoining the garden was his
extensive Floor Cloth Manufactory (on the site of which is now
Wellington Square).&nbsp; This spacious building was situated a
short distance from the road, and the approach to it was by a
carriage-way on each side, the centre being a grass plat.&nbsp;
In this manufactory were held most of the earlier annual meetings
of the Chelsea Auxiliary Bible Society, which were invariably
crowded.&nbsp; Amongst the speakers were the Rev. G. Clark, M.A.,
the Rev. John Owen, M.A., the Rev. Joseph Hughes, M.A., the Rev.
John Morison, D.D., the Rev. R. H. Shepherd, the Rev. John Bunce,
and several others.&nbsp; Mr. Downing, sen., was a gentleman
esteemed alike for his piety and benevolence, and his sons and
other branches of the family have at all times maintained a
similar respect.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The residence and manufactory which we have just described was
pulled down some years ago, and the present one was then
erected.&nbsp; A deplorable event occurred, about 38 years since,
at Messrs. Downings&rsquo; new Floor Cloth Manufactory, which it
is requisite to notice in a work of this description.&nbsp; A
young man, whose name was Butler, the son of very worthy parents,
and who had borne a tolerably good character previous to the
fatal event we are about to mention, was convicted and executed
at Newgate, for setting fire to a portion of the premises.&nbsp;
The fire broke out in or near to the stables, and as it occurred
on the Sunday morning, between the hours of twelve and one
o&rsquo;clock, the horses were of course locked in them.&nbsp; It
was with great difficulty that they were rescued.&nbsp; The
evidence, although principally circumstantial, resulted in the
jury finding a verdict of &ldquo;Guilty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the most strenuous efforts to save the life of
the young man, he suffered the extreme penalty of the then
law.&nbsp; A Wesleyan minister, who attended him at his last
moments, published a pamphlet stating his reasons for believing
that he was innocent.&nbsp; He was interred in St. Luke&rsquo;s
Burial Ground, and the Church was crowded to excess.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the same side of the road, and opposite Wellington Square,
was formerly the Nursery belonging to Mr. Moore.&nbsp; A little
further westward was the residence of Mr. Evans, sen., known as
Box Farm.&nbsp; For many years he lived there, and was much
respected in the parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>Smith
Street was begun to be built in 1794, by the late Thomas Smith,
Esq., of Manor Terrace, but it was not finally; completed until
about 1807.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Little&rsquo;s Nursery Ground was established many years
since, and at the present time it is celebrated for the
production of some of the choicest plants and flowers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Jubilee Place was first opened in 1809, and named in
commemoration of that event in the annals of the reign of George
the Third.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Flood Street, it appears, by ancient documents, was originally
called Pound Lane, probably from the pound of the manor standing
on or near its site.&nbsp; It was known for some years by the
name of Robinson&rsquo;s Lane, and since the buildings were
continued to the King&rsquo;s Road, it was, by an order from the
magistrates, called Queen Street.&nbsp; It has recently been
altered to Flood Street, so named as a tribute to the memory of
Luke Thomas Flood, Esq., for his munificent annual gifts to the
poor of this parish, and by doing which many mistakes are now
obviated, as there was and is still Queen&rsquo;s Road West
adjoining Cheyne Walk.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Upper Manor Street was originally called Wellesley Street, in
honour of the Rev. Dr. Wellesley, the then rector of the
parish.&nbsp; A murder was committed in this street about forty
years since, which created great excitement throughout
Chelsea.&nbsp; An elderly female resided in one of the houses,
and she was found dead early one morning under circumstances
which left no doubt whatever that the dreadful crime just
mentioned had been perpetrated.&nbsp; Two men were apprehended,
who lived in the neighbourhood, and who had been seen standing
near the house at about 12 o&rsquo;clock the preceding night, but
beyond that fact no further evidence was adduced.&nbsp; It
appeared they were both at a public house that evening, and left
when it was closed, but they produced no witnesses to prove that
they went afterwards direct to their homes.&nbsp; The evidence in
support of the charge being insufficient, the magistrate
discharged them.&nbsp; One of them was a second time charged with
the murder, but the result was the same.&nbsp; The name of the
street was then altered.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Robert Street, and the adjacent streets, have all been built
in the course of the present century.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Mr.
Roll&rsquo;s Nursery Grounds were situated two or three doors
from that old established house, the &ldquo;Six Bells,&rdquo; and
joined Argyll House.&nbsp; His son carried on the business for
many years, and the family were greatly respected.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Edward James Mascall, Esq., a gentleman who occasionally took
a very active part in parochial affairs, resided in what is now
called Argyll House for many years.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The entrance to Cook&rsquo;s Grounds, from the King&rsquo;s
Road, was anciently a back way to the stable-yard of Alston
House, in Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; Some years ago the stone frame-work
of the gate was visible in a garden in Upper Cheyne Row.&nbsp;
Formerly the parishioners had only the privilege of a footway
through the glebe land from the King&rsquo;s Road, as appears
from the following extract from the Vestry Minutes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;1755.&nbsp; Sept. 18.&nbsp; Whereas the road leading
from the north end of Great Cheyne Row over the glebe land to the
King&rsquo;s Private Road, is the proper right of Mr. John
Narbonne, of this parish, and whereas the inhabitants of this
parish do frequently pass and repass that way, not only with
corpse to the New Burying Ground, but to the Workhouse
contiguous, as well as to other places; and as the privilege is
only upon sufferance, by consent, and during the pleasure of Mr.
Narbonne, therefore we unanimously agree to pay him and his
heirs, as long as this privilege shall continue, upon the 1st day
of May in every year, being from the day the Burying Ground was
consecrated, the sum of one shilling, which we order shall be
paid by the churchwardens for the time being.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
have been no material alterations made from its recent state
during my remembrance; but Cook&rsquo;s Grounds will soon be no
longer recognised as it was in 1868, as many very superior houses
are now being erected, which will be presently noticed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Pamplin, another celebrated nurseryman, resided at the
western corner of Cook&rsquo;s Grounds.&nbsp; The old
dwelling-house has just been pulled down.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The King&rsquo;s Parade, opposite Cook&rsquo;s Grounds, was
erected in 1810.&nbsp; It is no longer known as the
&ldquo;Parade&rdquo;&mdash;principally so called on account of
the stone-pavement, which was considered then a luxury to walk on
at that part of the road&mdash;but is now included under the
general appellation of the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>Mr.
Edward Wright, comedian, of the Adelphi Theatre, lived at Merton
Villa, Trafalgar Square, opposite Cook&rsquo;s Grounds, for some
time.&nbsp; He died in France some few years ago.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the site of Oakley Square there still remained a portion of
Mrs. Hutchins&rsquo;s market garden.&nbsp; The road at this spot
was very narrow, and no pathway for passengers on that
side.&nbsp; Here, again, there was an obstructive bar placed
across the road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Faulkner mentions a singular circumstance that occurred
just at this place.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;About the year 1796, I
was present at a stag-hunt in Chelsea.&nbsp; The animal swam
across the river from Battersea, and made for Lord
Cremorne&rsquo;s grounds; and upon being driven from thence ran
along the water-side as far as the Church, and turning up Church
Lane (street), at last took refuge in Mrs. Hutchins&rsquo;s barn,
where he was taken alive.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A little on the west of Oakley Square, in a spacious house,
Mrs. Kelly, the author of several novels, conducted a most
respectable school.&nbsp; It was subsequently taken for the
reception of invalid soldiers, who came to pass the Board at
Chelsea Hospital, previous to their discharge from the
army.&nbsp; This house, long since pulled down, was said to have
been built about the year 1715.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Adjoining the preceding house, and at the corner of Upper
Church Street, was the &ldquo;Rose and Crown,&rdquo; a small
road-side public-house, standing much below the level of the
road, and, from its appearance, had evidently been built at an
early period.&nbsp; At the entrance was a wooden bench, on which
many a weary traveller took rest.&nbsp; On the site of this house
is now the Cadogan Arms.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Passing Church Street, and proceeding westward, the road was
extremely narrow.&nbsp; At the south corner of Church Street
there was an additional house to what there is at the present
time, and the old residence on the opposite side, lately pulled
down, projected several feet forward on the road, without any
pathway for foot-passengers.&nbsp; There is now a capital
carriage-road and a good pavement, with some commanding shops at
the northern corner.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Adjoining, on the north side of the King&rsquo;s Road, are the
extensive premises of Messrs. Ransome and Co., the eminent
saw-mill engineers, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>On
the opposite side were the Nursery Grounds belonging to Mr.
Shepard, the main portion of which now forms Paultons Square, and
the remainder, formerly in the occupation of Mr. H. Larner, has
recently been purchased by Mr. Gray, the horticultural builder,
in addition to his extensive works in Danvers Street.&nbsp; He is
making very considerable alterations, and, when completed, it
will no doubt be an ornament to this fashionably frequented
road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The late Mr. Alfred Mellon, so celebrated for his concerts,
and musical entertainments, lived for a considerable time in what
is known as &ldquo;The Vale,&rdquo; which is situated on the
opposite side to Paultons Square, where he died some two or three
years since.&nbsp; He was buried in the Brompton Cemetery, and
his funeral was attended by a great many of his private friends,
and by a large number of the most eminent men in the musical and
theatrical world, by all of whom he was highly respected.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. John Varley, the celebrated water colour painter, and
principal founder of the old Society now in Pall Mall East, whose
works are well known to the world, lived at 10, Beaufort Row, now
Beaufort Street, about the year 1810.&nbsp; His town house was in
Conduit Street, Regent Street.&nbsp; During the time he resided
here he made a very excellent drawing of the Old Church, from
near the Bishop of Winchester&rsquo;s Palace, in Cheyne Walk, the
property of J. H. Chance, Esq., which was lent and exhibited at
the Great Exhibition of 1862.&nbsp; Many other beautiful sketches
of Chelsea were made by Mr. Varley from the shores, as well as
from one of Mr. Bettsworth&rsquo;s boats, which was always at his
service.&nbsp; Some of the family have long been and are now
residents in Chelsea and Brompton.&nbsp; Mr. John Varley was born
in 1778, and died in 1842.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When Mr. Varley left Chelsea, Mr. Dorrell, the artist, took
the house, and afterwards Mr. J. Stark, the well-known oil
painter of woodland scenes, occupied it.&nbsp; Two prettily
painted pieces, although small, are now to be seen at the South
Kensington Museum.&nbsp; Mr. Stark was born in 1794, and died in
1859.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Wilson Lowry, F.R.S., M.G.S., lived near to Battersea Bridge,
about the year 1809.&nbsp; He was known not only for his eminence
as an engraver, but also for his extensive knowledge of anatomy,
natural philosophy, mathematics, mineralogy, and geology, <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>added to an
extraordinary talent for metaphysical discussion, which placed
him on terms of intimacy with the first philosophers and most
scientific men of his day, and in the year 1812, unsolicited, was
elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, next to Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the only artist who was honoured by such a
conferment.&nbsp; He died in 1824, in his 63rd year.&nbsp; Mr.
Lowry&rsquo;s only daughter by his second wife was Mr. John
Varley&rsquo;s second wife.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. John Galt, the author of &ldquo;Sir Archibald
Wylie,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Ayrshire Legatees,&rdquo; lived in
Beaufort Row about 1809.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Ralph Wedgwood, (of the firm of Josiah Wedgwood and Co.,)
the celebrated manufacturers of the Queen&rsquo;s Ware, died at
Chelsea in 1837.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Bentley, one of Mr. Wedgwood&rsquo;s partners,
superintended a branch establishment at Chelsea, about 1770, for
finishing and painting the best pieces.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Paul Bedford, the popular comedian, late of the Adelphi
and Haymarket Theatres, resides in Lindsey Place.&nbsp; He is
much respected in private life, and as an actor few have obtained
greater celebrity.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Returning to the King&rsquo;s Road, and proceeding from
Beaufort Street, we arrive at &ldquo;the Man in the Moon&rdquo;
tavern.&nbsp; There are many conjectures respecting the origin of
the sign of this house, but nothing certain has been
elucidated.&nbsp; As a celebrated neighbouring tavern was called
the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s End,&rdquo; perhaps the original
proprietor thought he would give his house an equally singular
sign.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We have already noticed the Clock House, Lord and Lady
Cremorne&rsquo;s Villa (now known as Cremorne Gardens),
Ashburnham House, Stanley House, St. Mark&rsquo;s College,
&amp;c.; but there are one or two others to which we will now
briefly allude.&nbsp; The first of these is Messrs.
Christie&rsquo;s Flour Mills, established a great many years
ago.&nbsp; The premises are situated at the western extremity of
the parish, and close to the Chelsea Railway Station.&nbsp; Mr.
Ormson, horticultural builder, resides at Dudmaston House, which
is opposite the entrance to St. Mark&rsquo;s College.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>The
King&rsquo;s Road, at the commencement of this century, was by no
means a place for general business.&nbsp; There were here and
there, it is true, tradesmen who succeeded very well, but,
generally speaking, the line of road was almost exclusively
occupied by nurserymen and florists, and thus it became a
fashionable resort for the nobility and gentry.&nbsp; The road,
in most parts, was very narrow, and the different grounds were
mostly enclosed by wooden palings.&nbsp; There was nothing like a
good pathway for passengers, excepting at certain places.&nbsp;
At night there were only a few gloomy oil-lamps, and the lives
and property of the inhabitants were principally entrusted to a
small number of private watchmen.&nbsp; When disturbances or
robberies in the streets occurred in the daytime, the
tradesmen-constables of the parish had the onerous and sometimes
the dangerous duty to quell them, and take into custody the
offenders or perpetrators.&nbsp; It need scarcely be added that
when sent for, on such occasions, the constables were
frequently&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Not at home</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let us now take a glance at the present state of the
King&rsquo;s Road, and a few more of the vast improvements which
have been made in it.&nbsp; But, before doing so, we will give
some particulars descriptive of a novel enterprise which is
attracting a large share of public attention at the present
time.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Chelsea Steam Captive
Balloon</span>.&mdash;This monster aerial balloon ascends daily,
weather permitting, from a part of the grounds known as the
Ashburnham estate, a little beyond Cremorne Gardens.&nbsp; The
balloon itself is 93 feet in diameter, and has a cubical capacity
for gas of 421,161 ft.&nbsp; It is capable of taking up into the
air no less than 30 passengers, and is attached to one strong
rope, 2000 ft. long, which passes round a balance wheel, and
thence to a large cylinder worked by an engine of 200 horse
power.&nbsp; These appliances are all fitted in a kind of
amphitheatre, from the centre of which the ascents take
place.&nbsp; The supposed altitude to which the rope allows
ascent is 2000 feet, but as a rule the height is generally
less.&nbsp; The cost of the balloon alone is stated to be
&pound;24,000, and the value of the gas required (pure hydrogen)
&pound;600.&nbsp; It is composed of linen and India rubber, made
of five thicknesses, and is the property of a French gentleman
well known for his attachment to scientific experiments.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>On
the opposite side of the road, and adjoining St. Mark&rsquo;s
College, is Mr. Veitch&rsquo;s Royal Exotic Nursery.&nbsp; These
grounds for a great many years belonged to Mr. Knight, who
possessed a most choice collection of Cape plants, &amp;c., and
who was patronized by nearly all the nobility and gentry in this
country.&nbsp; Mr. Veitch has fully sustained the celebrity
acquired by his predecessor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A little further eastward is Mr. W. Bull&rsquo;s Nursery, and
on the opposite side is the Ashburnham Park Nursery, belonging to
Mr. J. W. Wimsett.&nbsp; Both of them are distinguished
cultivators of rare and valuable plants.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near to Cremorne Gardens, on the opposite side of the road, is
the extensive Show Establishment belonging to John Weeks and Co.,
Horticultural Builders and Hot-Water Apparatus Manufacturers,
Engineers, and Iron Founders.&nbsp; The Horticultural Building
and Engineering department is carried on near to Messrs.
Downing&rsquo;s Floor Cloth Manufactory, in the King&rsquo;s
Road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Proceeding on, eastward, we arrive once more at Cook&rsquo;s
Grounds, which was, as previously stated, a private way
originally to the stabling of Sir Joseph Alston&rsquo;s House, in
Cheyne Walk.&nbsp; The old house, for so many years occupied by
Mr. Pamplin, the nurseryman, on the western entrance in the
King&rsquo;s Road, has recently been pulled down, and two
commanding shops erected on the site, by Mr. Leete, the builder,
of Little Cadogan Place.&nbsp; They contain thirteen rooms each,
built with white bricks and compo-dressings, with enrichments and
cornices.&nbsp; On the right-hand side of Cook&rsquo;s Grounds,
from the King&rsquo;s Road, about 30 superior-looking private
dwelling houses are now being built, each of which will contain
eight rooms.&nbsp; These are also built with white bricks, and
will have what is termed &ldquo;cant&rdquo; windows.&nbsp; The
road opposite them is intended to be 50 ft. wide, and there will
be a good pavement.&nbsp; When this great improvement is finally
completed, and carried forward to Cheyne Walk, which no doubt is
the intention, this new street will then scarcely be surpassed by
Oakley Street.&nbsp; In Trafalgar Square, likewise, there are a
number of very superior dwelling-houses now in course of
erection, and, when the entire square is finished, there will be
an excellent road from Cheyne Walk to the South Kensington
Museum.</p>
<h3><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>THE
VESTRY HALL.</h3>
<p>This building is situated on the south side of the
King&rsquo;s Road, and is nearly opposite Robert Street.&nbsp;
The foundation stone was laid on the 12th of December,
1859.&nbsp; The arrangements for the accommodation of the public
were under the superintendence of W. W. Pocock, Esq., the
architect, and notwithstanding it was a very inclement day, there
were at least a thousand persons present.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In a bottle were deposited a suitable inscription on vellum, a
list of the parish officers for the year, one copy of each of the
three Annual Reports of the Vestry, a copy of the
&ldquo;Metropolis Local Management Act,&rdquo; with its
Amendments, and of the &ldquo;Nuisances Removal Act,&rdquo; and
one of each of the Coins of the present Reign.&nbsp; The band of
the Royal Military Asylum attended, and played several popular
airs, which added greatly to enliven the proceedings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following particulars are extracted from the &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Morning Advertiser</span>,&rdquo; Tuesday, December
13th, 1859, and which were inserted in the Fourth Annual Report
of the Vestry, 1860.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The foundation stone was laid by Viscount Chelsea in due form,
in the presence of Robert Hanbury, Esq., and the Hon. G. Byng,
the Members for Middlesex, W. Tite, Esq., M.P., the Rev. C.
Kingsley, the Rector of the Parish, the Members of the Vestry,
and a large number of the influential inhabitants of the
parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The building is in the Italian style, with stone
facings.&nbsp; The length is about 140 ft., and between 60 and 70
feet in breadth.&nbsp; The great hall is 64ft. in length, and 40
ft. wide, and accommodates upwards of 1000 persons.&nbsp; The
board room is about 45 ft. by 30.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The time appointed for the ceremonial was two o&rsquo;clock in
the afternoon, and at half-past one o&rsquo;clock the gentlemen
invited to take part in the day&rsquo;s proceedings assembled in
the Vestry-Room of St. Luke&rsquo;s Church, and proceeded from
thence to the site of the proposed building, headed by the
juvenile band of the Royal Military Asylum, playing national and
other appropriate airs.&nbsp; <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>The procession, on arriving at the
spot, was received with loud cheers by a large number of the
inhabitants who were admitted within the grounds.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Tite, M.P., opened the business of the day in an
appropriate speech, in the course of which he alluded to the kind
gift of the freehold site by Earl Cadogan, the money for the
erection of the building having been voted by the Vestry.&nbsp;
The new hall, he said, when built, would not only be useful as
regarded parochial purposes, but it would be an ornament to that
locality.&nbsp; He was not disposed to introduce politics into a
matter so purely parochial, but he could not help saying that, in
the event of Chelsea obtaining a right to send representatives to
Parliament&mdash;to which it is fully entitled on account of the
number, respectability, and intelligence of its
inhabitants&mdash;they could meet in their new hall, and there
canvass and consider the claims of the candidates who presented
themselves for their suffrages.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Hanbury and Mr. Byng then severally addressed the numerous
assemblage in suitable speeches.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Charles Lahee, the respected Vestry Clerk, then read the
following document, which was afterwards deposited in the bottle
previously referred to:&mdash;&ldquo;This building, the
foundation stone of which was laid by the Right Hon. Lord
Viscount Chelsea, on the 12th day of our Lord one thousand eight
hundred and fifty nine, is intended for the transaction of the
parochial and municipal business of Chelsea, which contains at
the present time a population, by estimation, of seventy thousand
persons.&nbsp; It is built by the Vestry constituted by an Act
for the better Local Management of the Metropolis (18th &amp;
19th Victoria, cap. 120) upon freehold land presented them by the
Lord of the Manor, and his heirs, from the designs of Mr. Willmer
Pocock, architect, by Thomas Piper and Sons, builders.&nbsp;
Contract sum &pound;5630.&nbsp; Lord of the Manor, George, 3rd
Earl of Cadogan.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which was attached the names of
the Rector, Churchwardens, Vestrymen, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Richard Burgess, of Trinity Church, Sloane Street,
then offered an appropriate prayer, after which,</p>
<p>Mr. W. Rabbits, one of the vestrymen, presented a silver
trowel to Viscount Chelsea, to be used in laying the first stone,
and to be kept by his lordship as a token of the respect of the
parishioners for him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>Viscount Chelsea having expressed his acknowledgments
for the compliment paid him,</p>
<p>Mr. Pocock, the architect, then placed the bottle containing
the documents, &amp;c., in the cavity of the under stone, which
was covered with mortar.&nbsp; The other portion of the stone was
then let down, and Viscount Chelsea having gone through the usual
&ldquo;masonic&rdquo; operations in a workmanlike manner, his
lordship declared the Vestry Hall to be in due course of erection
amidst the loud cheers of all present.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The erection of the entire building was completed in 1860,
and, occupying such a central position, it adds materially to the
respectability of the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It is an
attractive structure, and its architectural design reflects great
credit on Mr. Pocock.&nbsp; The estimate laid before the Vestry
Finance Committee on the 21st of February, 1861, by Mr. Charles
Lahee, the Vestry Clerk, of the total probable cost of the Vestry
Hall buildings, including the fittings and furniture, was
altogether &pound;12,059 16s. 2d.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A portion of the building is occupied by the Chelsea Literary
and Scientific Institution, for the use of which a rental is
paid.&nbsp; T. L. Bull, Esq., was the original founder, and to
his indefatigable efforts, for a considerable time, may be
attributed the advantages that have been derived from it.&nbsp;
It appears, however, that the receipts of this useful and
admirable institution are unfortunately just now insufficient to
meet the necessary expenditure, but it is gratifying to record
that at a late influential meeting, held at the Vestry Hall, to
consider the &ldquo;present position and future prospects of the
Institution,&rdquo; and at which Lord George Hamilton, M.P.,
presided, it was unanimously resolved to extricate it from
temporary difficulties.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Charles Lahee, who has been Vestry Clerk for many years,
has a private dwelling-house at the Vestry Hall.&nbsp; The
offices are on the ground floor, and the large hall is at the
rear of the building.&nbsp; The spacious room above the offices,
and which fronts the road, is where the vestrymen weekly
assemble, adjoining it are committee rooms, &amp;c.&nbsp; The
whole interior is well-arranged and admirably adapted for the
requirements of the parish, which has now become one of the most
populous and important in the metropolis.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In Flood Street, near to the King&rsquo;s Road, is a small
Chapel belonging to the Primitive Methodists.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span><span
class="smcap">Methodist New Connexion Chapel</span>.&mdash;This
Chapel, which is situated in Radnor Street, King&rsquo;s Road,
was originally attached to the Commercial Tavern.&nbsp; After
some time had elapsed it was converted into a place for Divine
Worship, having undergone material alterations and made a
distinct building.&nbsp; The Rev. Clifford Hooper was the Pastor,
and the Congregation rapidly increasing they ultimately erected
the Congregational Church in Markham Square.&nbsp; When that
structure was completed, Radnor Street Chapel was purchased by
the Methodist New Connexion Society, and to that body of the
Christian church it still belongs.&nbsp; There is a very
excellent Sabbath School, and the members and friends have
expended, at different times, considerable sums in making it both
commodious and comfortable.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Savings&rsquo; Bank is situated on the north side of the
King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; It was established in the year
1819.&nbsp; The benefits derived by the labouring classes, and
others of limited means, by the establishment of such banks, are
now so well known and appreciated that it would be needless to
enumerate them.&nbsp; The Chelsea Savings&rsquo; Bank is one of
the most secure and best conducted in London.</p>
<h3>CHELSEA CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MARKHAM SQUARE.</span></h3>
<p>The foundation stone of this Chapel was laid on Tuesday,
October 5th, 1858, and the building was opened for public worship
on April 3rd, 1860, the Honourable and Rev. Baptist Noel, M.A.,
preaching at noon, and the Rev. Newman Hall, LL.B., in the
evening.&nbsp; The Rev. Clifford Hooper was the first
Pastor.&nbsp; He resigned the pastorate on account of failing
health on the 3rd of June, 1863, and died on March 6th,
1864.&nbsp; The Rev. R. Brindley, of Bath, then accepted the
pastorate, commencing his ministry on November 22nd, 1863, and on
October 19th, 1865, was suddenly and unexpectedly called to his
rest, in the very prime of life and in the midst of his
labours.&nbsp; The Rev. Andrew Mearns, of Great Marlow, was then
invited <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>to become Pastor, and commenced his ministry, at
Chelsea, on September 16th, 1866, where his pulpit ministrations
and pastoral labours have been greatly blessed.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chapel stands in a very prominent position, covering a
large piece of ground at the north end of Markham Square, forming
a very conspicuous and beautiful object from the King&rsquo;s
Road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The form of the building is slightly cruciform, having
transepts projecting about five feet from the body of the
Chapel.&nbsp; The prominent feature of the exterior is a tower
and spire, rising from the west side of the southern transept to
the height of 138 feet.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The proportions are well-conceived, and the effect good.&nbsp;
The dimensions in the clear, are, length 85 ft. 2 in.; length,
including apse, 93 ft. 6 in.; width 41 ft. 3 in.; width across
transept 51 ft. 3 in.; height from floor of chapel to ridge of
open roof, 49 ft.; height from floor to roof, on the wall line,
22 ft.; and the height of school rooms 13 ft.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The style of the building is in the second period of the
Gothic.&nbsp; The exterior is entirely of stone; the interior,
will accommodate on the ground and gallery floors, 1,150 adults,
besides an additional gallery in the apse for the organ and
choir.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The ground floor is raised about four feet above the footway,
and beneath are lofty and spacious schoolrooms for about 850
children, with requisite offices.&nbsp; The building was erected
from a design by John Tarring, Esq., of Bucklersbury, and Messrs.
Myers, of Lambeth, were the contractors who undertook the
erection.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Sabbath School is well attended, and the labours of the
teachers and superintendent very successful.&nbsp; Above 380
children are registered as scholars, and, on Feb. 28, the actual
attendance was 256 in the morning and 356 in the afternoon,
taught by 33 teachers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The various institutions and agencies connected with this
Church are likewise flourishing under the oversight of the
Pastor, who, we trust, may be long spared to a beloved and loving
people.</p>
<h3><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>WHITELANDS TRAINING INSTITUTION.</h3>
<p>The old house now attached to these extensive premises was for
many years a boarding school, conducted by the Misses
Babington.&nbsp; Previous to that period it had no doubt been a
scholastic establishment for young ladies, as I find that a
discourse was delivered here, about 1772, by the Rev. John
Jenkins, A.M., on Female Education and Christian Fortitude under
Affliction.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the year 1842 the house and grounds were taken on a long
lease by the National Society, and in 1850 a public meeting was
held in London to raise funds for the erection of the present
buildings.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Institution provides for the education, maintenance, and
training of more than 100 young women, between the ages of 18 and
25, who purpose to become teachers of National Schools; and,
secondly, for the daily instruction of children of the
neighbourhood, in four schools.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In one of these schools the charge of 10s. per quarter is
made.&nbsp; It is attended by children whose parents would not
wish to send them to the National Schools.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The vast improvements which are everywhere conspicuous
throughout the length of the King&rsquo;s Road, as regards that
portion of it which is within the boundaries of Chelsea, are far
more numerous than in any other road in the metropolis.&nbsp; At
the eastern and western extremities of the parish, there are
Railway Stations, then there are the steamboats, besides these
there are the omnibuses traversing the road every quarter of an
hour.&nbsp; What a contrast does the King&rsquo;s Road now
present when compared with what it was at the commencement of
this century!</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I now return to the bank of the Thames, passing through Flood
Street, proceeding eastward along Queen&rsquo;s Road West,
(formerly called Paradise Row,) the residence of many of the
Nobility and Gentry in the &ldquo;Olden Times.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Queen&rsquo;s Road West.</h3>
<p>In the year 1664, Mr. James Hamilton, probably by order of the
Lord of the Manor, made a survey of this parish.&nbsp; It was
further continued, till the year 1715, by the Rev. Dr. King, the
rector, to whose labours this work is much indebted.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From Hamilton&rsquo;s survey, it appears that the Earl of
Radnor resided in Paradise Row, <a name="citation177"></a><a
href="#footnote177" class="citation">[177]</a> adjoining
Robinson&rsquo;s Lane.&nbsp; He entertained his Majesty King
Charles II. most sumptuously on the 4th of September, 1660, at
this house.&nbsp; When the above survey was taken, his relict,
Lady Radnor, was in possession of the premises.&nbsp; There are
in the Parish Register several entries of baptisms and deaths of
this family.&nbsp; Lord Radnor died at this house July 17, 1685,
and Lady Radnor, his second wife, who survived him, resided at
Chelsea till her death in 1714.&nbsp; His son, Francis, by his
second wife, who was a gentleman of general learning and good
abilities, was buried at Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the north end of George Place, Queen&rsquo;s Road West,
formerly stood an old white house, called &ldquo;Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Larder,&rdquo; which was pulled down to erect
the present houses.</p>
<h3>THE BOTANIC GARDEN.</h3>
<p>On the south side of Queen&rsquo;s Road West, near to the
river, is situated the garden belonging to the Company of
Apothecaries.&nbsp; The earliest record that we possess of a
Botanical Garden in England, was that of the celebrated John
Gerarde, the father of English botany.&nbsp; The next in order of
time was that of the elder Tradescant, who, about 1630,
established a garden for the cultivation of exotic plants at
South Lambeth; this collection was presented, in 1667, to the
University of Oxford.&nbsp; The next garden in succession is this
at Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Of these premises, containing three acres, one rood, the first
lease was taken by the Company in the year 1673, for the term <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>of 61
years, at a ground rent of &pound;5 per annum.&nbsp; Mr. Evelyn
thus mentions a visit he paid it:&mdash;&ldquo;1685, August 7th,
I went to see Mr. Watts, keeper of the Apothecaries&rsquo; garden
of simples at Chelsea, where there is a collection of innumerable
rarities of that sort particularly; besides many rare annuals,
the true-bearing Jesuits&rsquo; Bark, which had done such wonders
in quartan agues.&nbsp; What was very ingenious was the
subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove under the conservatory,
all vaulted with bricks, so as he has the doors and windows open
in the hardest frosts, secluding all the snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Watts was succeeded by Mr. Doody, who enjoyed considerable
eminence as a botanist, and he continued to superintend it till
1717, when the celebrated Petiver was appointed, who had
officiated as demonstrator of plants since 1709.&nbsp; He
accumulated so large a collection of natural history, that, some
time before his death, Sir Hans Sloane is said to have offered
him &pound;4000 for it.&nbsp; After his death, Sir Hans Sloane
purchased it, and it went eventually to the British Museum.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Hans Sloane granted the freehold of these premises, in
1722, upon conditions that the Company should pay a quit rent of
&pound;5 per annum for ever, and employ the same as a Physic
Garden; that the Company should deliver to the Royal Society
fifty specimens, the growth of the garden, till the number should
amount to three thousand.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was here that Sir Hans Sloane first studied his favourite
science; and he continued a friend to this establishment,
continually enriching it with scarce and curious plants, besides
contributing largely towards the building, &amp;c.&nbsp; As a
tribute of gratitude the Company of Apothecaries employed the
celebrated Rysbrach on a marble statue of their benefactor, which
stands in the middle of the garden.&nbsp; He is represented in a
Doctor&rsquo;s gown, with a full-bottomed peruke, and a roll in
his right hand.&nbsp; It displays much dignity, and conveys a
most pleasing impression of the learned person whom it
represents.&nbsp; On the north side of the pedestal is the
following inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;In honour and perpetuation of
the memory of Sir Hans Sloane, Bart., an eminent physician, and
great encourager of the science of botany, this statue was
erected by the Company of Apothecaries of London,
1733.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the west side, &ldquo;They being sensible
how necessary that branch of science is to the faithful
discharging the duty of their profession, with grateful hearts
and general consent, ordered this statue to be erected in the
year of our Lord 1733, that their successors and posterity may
never forget their common <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>benefactor.&nbsp; Placed here in the
year 1737.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is another inscription, similar in
purport, on the south side of the pedestal.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The garden is laid out in divisions, in which the plants,
shrubs, and trees, are arranged systematically.&nbsp; On the
south side of the garden, facing the Thames, formerly stood two
large cedars of Lebanon.&nbsp; Lysons says, that Sir Joseph Banks
made an accurate admeasurement of these trees, in 1793, and found
the girth of the larger to be twelve feet eleven inches and a
half, that of the smaller twelve feet and half an inch.&nbsp;
Upon being measured again, in 1809, they had increased twelve
inches in girth since 1793.&nbsp; There is now only one of these
trees.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Philip Miller resided many years in the house at the
garden, and rendered himself particularly distinguished by his
botanical works.&nbsp; He succeeded to the office of curator of
this establishment in 1722, and resigned a little before his
decease, which took place in 1771.&nbsp; He was buried in Chelsea
churchyard, where a monument has been since erected to his memory
by the Fellows of the Linnean and Horticultural Societies of
London.&nbsp; He was succeeded in the management of the garden by
his pupil, Mr. Forsyth, who, in 1784, was appointed chief
superintendent of the Royal Gardens at Kensington, which he held
till his death in 1804.&nbsp; Mr. Anderson was subsequently
curator, and Mr. Wheeler demonstrator.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having thus endeavoured to give a brief sketch of the rise and
progress of this establishment, it only remains to mention a few
particulars in reference to its present condition.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Within the last twenty-five years the garden has been in a
great measure remodelled, and in consequence has become better
adapted to the purpose for which it is maintained, namely, the
instruction of medical students.&nbsp; Several of the old
hot-houses and greenhouses have been removed, and new ones
erected in their place; new arrangements of medicinal plants have
been formed; and groups representing the natural orders of plants
have been brought together to facilitate their study.&nbsp;
Formerly two cedars of Lebanon, some of the first planted in
England, were conspicuous objects from the river, but in 1853 one
of these, which had become much decayed, was blown down, the
other still remains, but is gradually decaying, being not only
injuriously affected by the smoke of London, but like all the
other large trees in the garden, more or less damaged by <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>the
deprivation of water caused by the construction of the deep sewer
in the Queen&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; A fine specimen of a rare tree,
the Salisburia adiantifolia, the Ginkgo of Japan, with leaves
resembling those of the Maidenhair Fern in form, may be seen
towering above the wall in the Queen&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; The
alterations in this garden were commenced in 1846 by Mr. Robt.
Fortune, the Chinese traveller, who was succeeded, in 1848, by
Mr. Thomas Moore, the present Curator.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near to the Botanic Garden, in front of the river, stood a
capital mansion, erected in the reign of Queen Anne, which was
for many years inhabited by Mrs. Banks, the mother of Sir Joseph
Banks.</p>
<h3>CHRIST CHURCH.</h3>
<p>This Church was consecrated on the 26th of June, 1839.&nbsp;
It stands on a piece of ground for many years previously a market
garden, and is situated in Paradise Street, Queen&rsquo;s Road
West.&nbsp; The exterior is particularly plain, and would admit
of great improvements were there funds available for such a
purpose.&nbsp; The interior will probably seat about 1000
persons.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the street there are
neatly-designed schoolrooms, in which the children belonging to
the National, Infant, and Sunday Schools assemble for
instruction.&nbsp; Each of these schools is very well
attended.&nbsp; The residents in a great portion of the immediate
locality are poor, and consequently the most strenuous efforts
are necessary to raise sufficient funds to meet the
expenditure.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. W. H. Howard, M.A., was the first Incumbent of the
Church, and was much esteemed.&nbsp; He was a kind-hearted
clergyman, and made every effort in his power to promote the
spiritual and temporal welfare of the numerous poor in his
district.&nbsp; He resigned in 1845.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. W. W. Robinson, M.A., was, as is well known, most
zealous in his exertions to accomplish the same great
object.&nbsp; He was likewise a most strenuous supporter and
advocate of Total Abstinence Societies from all intoxicating
liquors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>The
Rev. G. S. Whitlock, M.A., succeeded Mr. Robinson.&nbsp; He
displays an untiring zeal in the discharge of his sacred duties,
and there are gratifying testimonies to prove that his
ministerial labours have been blessed.&nbsp; Under his energetic
administration of affairs a large amount of voluntary
subscriptions have been collected, and many important
improvements in the interior of the Church have been effected,
and should he be spared to the District, no doubt the exterior
will soon likewise have a more imposing appearance.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Gough House</span> was erected at the
commencement of the last century by John, third Earl of
Carberry.&nbsp; He died in his coach, as he was returning from
London to this house in 1713, and was interred in Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; After his death the house and premises were in
possession of the Gough family, several of whom resided
here.&nbsp; Sir Richard Gough was a merchant in London; he died
in 1727.&nbsp; Sir Henry Gough took the name of Calthorpe, in
compliance with the will of his uncle, Sir Henry Calthorpe, K.B.,
and was created a peer, in 1796, by the title of Baron
Calthorpe.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The house was at length occupied by Mrs. Pemberton, who
conducted an establishment for the education of young ladies for
many years.&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Wilson, D.D., subsequently
resided in it for a considerable period.&nbsp; At the present
time the approach to this old mansion presents a melancholy
contrast to what it was in former days.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Gough House is now the Victoria Hospital for Sick Children,
established in 1866.&nbsp; The frontage is otherwise occupied,
and consequently the originally attractive appearance is entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; The youthful patients come from all parts of the
metropolis, and several from the country.&nbsp; The objects of
the institution are as follow:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The treatment, as in-patients, of children between
the ages of two and twelve years.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The treatment, as out-patients, of children under
sixteen years of age.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The training of nurses for children.</p>
<p>The Rev. A. G. W. Blunt, M.A., Rector of Chelsea, takes a deep
interest in promoting this much-needed and admirable <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>institution.&nbsp; The committee are now earnestly
making an appeal for contributions to create a Building Fund, and
when it is known that there is not in all the metropolis a single
hospital <span class="GutSmall">BUILT</span> for the special
reception of children, it is to be hoped that such a noble
charity will receive the liberal assistance of all benevolent
persons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Edward Montague, first Earl of Sandwich, resided in this
neighbourhood in 1663.&nbsp; Mr. Pepys, in his Diary, has
recorded a visit he paid to that nobleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;March 28,
1663.&nbsp; To Chelsea, where we found my lord all alone, with
one joint of meat at dinner, and mightily extolling the manner of
his retirement, and the goodness of his diet; the mistress of the
house hath all things most excellently dressed; amongst other
things her cakes admirable, and so good, that my lord&rsquo;s
words were, they were fit to present to Lady Castlemaine . . .
&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Archbishop Sharpe resided here about 1691; he preached the
sermon at the coronation of Queen Anne.&nbsp; Mackay says,
&ldquo;He is one of the greatest ornaments of the Church of
England, of great piety and learning, a black man, and 55 years
old.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles, Duke of St. Albans, natural son of Charles II. by
Eleanor Gwynn, had a house here about 1692.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Fitton Gerrard, the last Earl of Macclesfield of that family,
died at his house in Chelsea, in 1702.&nbsp; A law-suit was
commenced about the right of succession to his property, between
Lord Mohun and the Duke of Hamilton, who had married his
niece.&nbsp; A duel was fought between the competitors in Hyde
Park, which proved fatal to both parties.&nbsp; The Duchess lived
in Chelsea till 1714.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry, Duke of Kent, had a house in Queen&rsquo;s Road West,
about 1715.&nbsp; On his Grace&rsquo;s death, in 1740, the
Dukedom of Kent became extinct.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The beautiful Duchess of Mazarin resided in Queen&rsquo;s Road
West, and died there in 1699, aged 52.&nbsp; Her dramatic routs
and musical entertainments were celebrated for their
magnificence.&nbsp; The singers were from the theatres, and the
instrumental performers the most eminent masters of the
time.&nbsp; It is said that the design of introducing the Italian
Opera into <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>England was first concerted in this assembly.&nbsp;
Lysons was told that it was usual for the nobility and others who
dined at her house to leave money under their plates to pay for
their entertainment.&nbsp; She appears to have been in arrears
for the parish rates during the whole time of her residence at
Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mrs. Mary Astell resided here the greater part of her life,
which was spent in writing for the advancement of learning,
religion, and virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;The good Christian,&rdquo; she
would say, &ldquo;only hath reason to be cheerful in this
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; She died at her house in 1731, in her 63rd
year, beloved by all who knew her, and greatly esteemed by the
inhabitants.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Richard Mead, it appears by the parish books, resided here
about 1714; he was an eminent physician.&nbsp; Matthew Mead, his
father, was a celebrated Nonconformist divine.&nbsp; Dr. Mead had
a house also in Great Ormond Street, which became a repository
for all that was curious in nature and art.&nbsp; He built a
gallery for his pictures and antiquities, which, when sold,
produced as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The world was deprived of this distinguished physician in
1754.&nbsp; To the poor he gave money as well as advice.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Francis Windham had a house in Queen&rsquo;s Road West,
about 1700.&nbsp; He entertained Charles II. at Trent, after the
battle of Worcester, where the king remained concealed for
several days.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. James Miller was born in 1703.&nbsp; He wrote the
oratorio of &ldquo;Joseph and his Brethren,&rdquo; and translated
and adapted to the English stage, the &ldquo;Mahomet&rdquo; of
Voltaire, which met with great applause; but on the third night
of its representation, being for his own benefit, he died
suddenly at his house at Chelsea, in 1743.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Alexander Blackwell, a physician, resided in a house near
the Botanic Garden; he became involved in his circumstances, <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>and was
taken to prison for debt.&nbsp; Mrs. Blackwell possessed by
nature a fine genius for drawing and painting, and being told
that a Herbal was wanted, she drew from the life several of the
physical plants.&nbsp; These were shewn to several eminent men,
who being pleased with the undertaking she proceeded with the
work, and at length procured her husband&rsquo;s liberty.&nbsp;
She not only made the drawings, but engraved them on copper
plates, and coloured them.&nbsp; This celebrated work was
completed in 1739.&nbsp; Mr. Rand, who had the care of the
Botanic Garden, rendered her every assistance in his power.&nbsp;
Unfortunately Dr. Blackwell left Chelsea and went to Sweden,
where he was appointed physician to the king.&nbsp; Sometime
afterwards, however, he was found guilty of high treason
&ldquo;in plotting to overturn the constitution of the kingdom,
and sentenced to be broken alive on the wheel.&rdquo; <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a>&nbsp; It is further said that
&ldquo;he prayed with great devotion; but, having laid his head
wrong, he remarked jocosely that, being his first experiment, no
wonder he should want a little instruction.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
jocularity, at such an awful moment, does not accord with earnest
prayer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. Thomas Stackhouse, a learned and pious divine,
resided in Queen&rsquo;s Road West, about the year 1750; he was
the author of &ldquo;The History of the Bible,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. John Collett, the painter, resided here for a long
period.&nbsp; The favourite subjects of his pencil were pieces of
humour, somewhat in imitation of Hogarth.&nbsp; Collett died here
in 1780.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. John Giles Eccardt had a house here for some years, and
died in 1779; he was a painter of some eminence.&nbsp; The
portrait of Gay, the poet, in Lord Orford&rsquo;s works, now
almost extant, is from a painting by Eccardt.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. W. Hamilton, a pleasing artist, resided also here for
several years; his most capital work was &ldquo;The Queen of
Sheba entertained at a banquet by Solomon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>Mary,
Duchess of Ormond, resided in a large house, near Chelsea
Hospital, in 1730.&nbsp; She was a daughter of the Duke of
Beaufort, and the second wife of James, Duke of Ormond.&nbsp;
This house was for many years afterwards occupied as a
school.&nbsp; It enjoyed a distinguished reputation for maritime
education.&nbsp; The novelty of having a ship built on the
play-ground, completely rigged, with sails bent, and of capacity
sufficient to admit of twenty-four of the young gentlemen going
aloft at one time, attracted general notice.&nbsp; This ship
moved round on swivels, which enabled her to represent the
evolutions of wearing or tacking.&nbsp; She was under the care of
an old naval lieutenant, and was named &ldquo;The
Cumberland.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Robert Walpole had a house and garden &ldquo;next the
College.&rdquo;&nbsp; He built here an octagon summer-house and a
large greenhouse, the latter filled with fine exotics by Lady
Walpole; he had also a curious grotto.&nbsp; Nell Gwynn is said
to have lived in this house when it was Crown property.&nbsp; It
was taken down about 1808.&nbsp; On the site of this house is now
a spacious infirmary for the sick and aged pensioners of Chelsea
Hospital.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">School of Discipline</span>.&mdash;This is
the oldest Reformatory for young girls in London.&nbsp; It was
opened by Mrs. Elizabeth Fry, who, with some Christian friends,
brought six other children from Newgate to a small house at
Chelsea, in 1825.&nbsp; Since that time a larger house has been
taken in Queen&rsquo;s Road West, near to Chelsea Hospital, and
the number of children increased.&nbsp; They are daily instructed
in the love and fear of God, carefully trained in all useful
branches of household work, needlework, and the usual subjects of
elementary secular education.&nbsp; The number of children now
boarded, clothed, and educated in the school is 42.&nbsp; It is a
&ldquo;Certified Industrial School,&rdquo; for the purpose of
receiving, by magistrates warrants, girls who are either found
begging, homeless, or frequent the company of thieves,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Twenty-one of such, in 1869, were under
detention.&nbsp; They are paid for by the Home Office, the
parents, where possible, contributing to their maintenance.&nbsp;
The others are such as need restraint and discipline, and the
parents are required to pay sums varying from 6d. to 5s.,
according to their means.&nbsp; It is conducted by a
Ladies&rsquo; Committee, Mrs. Cromwell, the lady of the Principal
of St. Mark&rsquo;s College, kindly discharging the duties of
honorary secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Faulkner, to whom this work is so greatly indebted,
lived at the corner house, opposite the grounds of <a

parish, and possessed great literary attainments.&nbsp; As a
local historian none have excelled him, and in private life no
parishioner was more respected.&nbsp; He was interred in the
Brompton Cemetery, where there is the following inscription to
his memory:&mdash;&ldquo;Thomas Faulkner, the historian of
Chelsea, and an inhabitant of that parish 60 years.&nbsp; Born

side of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, where he had been educated as
one of the choir; his disposition was amiable, and the needy
always shared his mite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Durham House</span>.&mdash;It appears that
a large house was standing on this spot in 1694, it was then
called the Ship House, and is said traditionally to have been a
tavern, and frequented by the workmen whilst the Royal Hospital
was building.&nbsp; The present structure, which was built in the
beginning of the last century, has been distinguished for a great
number of years as an eminent school.&nbsp; It is at present in
the occupation of the Rev. John Wilson, D.D., of Holy Trinity
Church, Knightsbridge.</p>

<p>Durham Place was built in 1790, by Mr. Richardson, who was for

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Green&rsquo;s Row, a little eastward, was built in 1765.&nbsp;
It was for many years the property of a Mr. Green, an extensive

Mr. Blunt, sen., was universally respected in the parish.&nbsp;
He held a commission in Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Chelsea Royal

187</span>Chelsea Royal Hospital.</h3>
<p>On the site of this noble establishment&mdash;the home of our
military veterans&mdash;was originally a college or place of
education for controversial divines.&nbsp; It was projected by
Dr. Sutcliffe, Dean of Exeter, in the reign of James I.&nbsp; The
king was one of its best patrons, and supported it by various
grants and benefactions; he himself laid the first stone of the
edifice, in 1609; gave timber requisite for the building, and
ordered that when erected it should be called &ldquo;King
James&rsquo;s College at Chelsey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus fortified,
Dean Sutcliffe experienced no difficulty in obtaining from
Charles, Earl of Nottingham, an advantageous lease of a plot of
land which the latter held under the Crown, and which was called
&ldquo;Thame Shot,&rdquo; for which he paid the yearly rent of
seven pounds ten shillings.&nbsp; A charter of incorporation was
granted, which limited the number of its members to a provost and
nineteen fellows, of whom seventeen were to be in holy orders,
the other two might be laymen.&nbsp; Their employment was to
consist in noticing and recording the principal historical and
religious events which might occur during the time they remained
in office; but none of the members, on being elected bishops,
could be permitted to retain their fellowships; by this charter,
also, the college was enabled to use a corporate seal.&nbsp; The
building, however, progressed but slowly.&nbsp; The Dean&rsquo;s
funds became exhausted; the proceeds of the king&rsquo;s letter
proved small.&nbsp; Out of two quadrangles which it was
contemplated to erect, and of which the lesser was to be
internally surrounded by a piazza, only a portion of one side was
completed.&nbsp; Still the number of those who took an interest
in the matter daily increased, and were far from
despairing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The work we confess,&rdquo; says Darley,
&ldquo;hitherto proceeded slowly; and no marvel, seeing great
works are not easily achieved.&nbsp; Noah&rsquo;s Ark,
God&rsquo;s Tabernacle and Temple, &amp;c., were long in
building; and do we wonder that this college is not
finished?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Several causes contributed to render the king&rsquo;s appeal
through the medium of the bishops of slight avail.&nbsp; In the
first place, the expenses attending the collection of briefs were
then inordinate.&nbsp; The money, after it had been gathered,
passed through many hands, each of which took care to attach a
portion to itself; while the efforts made about the same time to
push <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>forward the building of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
stood very much in the way of the completion of King
James&rsquo;s College. <a name="citation188"></a><a
href="#footnote188" class="citation">[188]</a>&nbsp; With James
I. died the only conscientious supporter, excepting the founder,
and a few churchmen; the death of Sutcliffe was a deadly blight
upon the prospects of his infant college.&nbsp; It was afterwards
converted into a place for prisoners of war; and, with the manor,
of which the Parliament took forcible possession, was ultimately
put up to sale.&nbsp; Darley says, &ldquo;It became a cage of
unclean beasts, a stable for horses; and not only a place to make
leaden guns in, but desired also for a palcestra to manage great
horses and to practise horsemanship.&rdquo;&nbsp; A print of the
original design of this college was prefixed to a small book,
called &ldquo;The Glory of Chelsey College,&rdquo; by John
Darley, B.D., Rector of Northill, Cornwall.&nbsp; 1662.&nbsp;
Archbishop Laud called it sneeringly &ldquo;Controversy
College.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1667, Charles II. resolved on granting this college to the
Royal Society, which was about that time incorporated.&nbsp; And
as a grant of the manor of Chelsea had been made to the Duke of
Hamilton by Charles I., the heirs of that nobleman now conveyed
it to Andrew Cole, in trust, for that learned body.&nbsp; The
Society, however, did not hold their sittings in it, probably
from its dilapidated state; they ultimately conveyed it, in 1681,
to Sir Stephen Fox, for the king&rsquo;s use, in order to build
Chelsea Hospital, for the sum of &pound;1,300.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I will now give a description of the establishment of Chelsea
Hospital.&nbsp; The building, as it now stands, was begun by
Charles II., continued during the short reign of his successor,
and completed by William and Mary.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It has been just stated that the site of King James&rsquo;s
College was purchased of the Royal Society for the purpose of
erecting this Hospital; but not being found sufficient, the lands
lying between the College and the river Thames, and that in front
of the present Hospital, now called Burton&rsquo;s Court, were
also purchased of Lord Cheyne and Sir Thomas Grosvenor, for about
the sum of &pound;1100.&nbsp; About twenty-two acres of this
land, lying on the eastern side, were, in 1690, granted by the
Crown to the Earl of Ranelagh.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>There
are several pleasing legends told as to the origin of Chelsea
Hospital.&nbsp; The following is one of them:&mdash;The King was
sitting in his chariot, with poor Nell Gwynne, when observing her
unusually pensive, he asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What ails thee, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied: &ldquo;A dream I had last night, troubleth me
sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>was</i> thy dream, Nell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methought I was in the fields at Chelsea, and slowly
and majestically there rose before mine eyes, a beautiful palace
of a thousand chambers; and in and out thereat walked divers many
old and worn-out soldier-men.&nbsp; Some had lost a leg, some an
arm, others were blind of an eye, many bore piteous scars of old
wounds in the wars, upon their wrinkled faces, and all of them
were aged, and past service.&nbsp; But none of them looked
ill-at-ease, and as they went out, and as they came in, the old
men cried, &lsquo;God bless King Charles!&rsquo; and I awoke, and
was sore discomfitted, that it was only a dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Nelly,&rdquo; said the King.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy
dream shall be fulfilled, mayhap, thou shalt yet see old soldiers
come in, and go out, crying, &lsquo;God bless King
Charles!&rsquo;&nbsp; The monarch did violence to his infirmity,
and kept his word.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No appeal seems to have been made to the public at large, as
was the case with King James&rsquo;s College; but while the
voluntary contributions of the charitable were received with
gratitude, the troops were, to a certain extent, burdened with
the expenses of the asylum from which they were themselves to
derive the sole benefit.&nbsp; From the pay given to these, a
deduction was made of one shilling in the pound; which, being
divided into three equal parts, was one to defray the expenses of
the Paymaster&rsquo;s office, one to the general use of the
soldiers, and one to the accumulation of a fund, first, for the
building, and ultimately for the maintenance of the
hospital.&nbsp; By giving to this a retrospective effect, so as
to include the whole of the year 1680, and strengthened by
donations of &pound;1,300 from Sir Stephen Fox, of &pound;1,000
from Tobias Rustas, Esq., of &pound;1,000 from Sancroft,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and of nearly &pound;7,000 from the
Secret Service Fund, the projectors of the establishment had at
their disposal a sum of &pound;17,012 14s. 7d. with which they
determined to make a beginning.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>The
edifice was consequently begun in the year 1682, but was not
completed till 1690.&nbsp; King Charles II., attended by a great
number of the principal nobility and gentry, laid the first stone
of this magnificent structure on the 16th of February,
1682.&nbsp; The whole expense of the building is computed to have
amounted to &pound;150,000.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Christopher Wren, to whose genius and abilities we owe the
grandest edifices of which our metropolis can boast, gave the
original design, and conducted the building to its
completion.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Chelsea Hospital is generally considered to be a fine specimen
of Sir Christopher Wren&rsquo;s professional abilities.&nbsp; It
possesses a superior air of grandeur, more spacious arrangement
of the principal parts, greater attention to the central points,
for grace and effect, and a higher degree of chastity maintained
in the whole structure than any public design entered into by Sir
Christopher Wren, or his immediate successors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the grand entrance, from the King&rsquo;s Road, are four
detached stone piers, with breaks, with an entablature, on which
are military trophies.&nbsp; These piers, by their disposure,
give three passes; the iron gates much modernised; dwarf walls,
having cornices in succession, containing small door-ways.&nbsp;
Two lodges, right and left, carry on the line, containing four
compartments, or blank windows each.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The central approach, from the King&rsquo;s Road to the north
general front of the Hospital, including the Royal Avenue, has a
very imposing effect, with trees on either side.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It would be impossible to give in this work an architectural
description of Chelsea Hospital, or of its arrangements.&nbsp; It
is within the reach of every inhabitant of London, and now as our
country friends have the benefit of frequent railway excursions,
almost every person in the country, may at any time give this
home of England&rsquo;s worn out and gallant defenders a personal
inspection.&nbsp; Still it is necessary that a general sketch of
the building and grounds should be given.&nbsp; I have therefore
extracted most of the following particulars from Mr.
Gleig&rsquo;s admirable work.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Chelsea Hospital occupies, with the buildings, courts,
gardens, and offices attached, an area of something more than 54
square acres.&nbsp; Its principal courts, or quadrangles, are
three in number; <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>of which the central alone existed in 1690, though the
good taste of a modern architect has provided that no discordance
in style should be anywhere perceptible between the nucleus and
the additions which have, from to time, gathered round it.&nbsp;
Over the whole, there hangs an air of sobered and collegiate
repose, as far removed from gloom on the one hand, as from
garishness on the other; a character every way suitable to the
purposes to which the edifice has been set apart, and in strict
accordance with the habits and condition of its inmates.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The central court, which is open towards the south, and
separated from what are called the water-gardens only by an iron
railing, is closed in on the east and west by two ranges of
buildings 365ft. in length by 40 in width; on the north and south
by the hall and chapel, divided one from the other by a handsome
cupola and gateway.&nbsp; In these long buildings, or wings, to
the extent at least of 200ft. the old soldiers are chiefly
housed&mdash;that is to say, such of them as are rated in the
hospital books as privates, corporals, and sergeants.&nbsp;
Sixteen wards or barracks arranged each into 26 bed places,
furnish the men with adequate accommodation; while the sergeants
occupy cabins, closed in, one at each extremity of the ward, in
which it is their duty to preserve order.&nbsp; For the captains
and light-horse distinct lodgings are provided.&nbsp; At the
southern extremity of each wing, so as to project into the
water-gardens, are the apartments of the Governor and the
Lieutenant-Governor, both comfortable dwellings, altogether free
from ostentation, yet well fitted for the uses of the
distinguished officers to whom the honour of presiding over the
first of England&rsquo;s military establishments may be
assigned.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Go with old Thames, view Chelsea&rsquo;s
glorious pile,<br />
And ask the shatter&rsquo;d hero whence his smiles;<br />
Go view the splendid domes of Greenwich&mdash;go,<br />
And own what raptures from reflection flow.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Rogers</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Chapel and Hall present, when examined from without, a
perfect uniformity of appearance.&nbsp; Each has its plain brick
front, indented with tall arched windows; and each appears to
lean upon the noble stone pillars that flank the central gateway;
while along that face that looks in upon the square, is a piazza,
or covered gallery.&nbsp; Beneath are benches, on which the old
men may occasionally be seen smoking their pipes in the heat of a
summer&rsquo;s day; while from either end branches off a passage,
opening out a communication with the lesser or flanking <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>quadrangles.&nbsp; Moreover, the cornice of this piazza
bears a neat inscription, indicative of the purpose which the
hospital is meant to serve, and partly commemorative of the names
of the sovereigns to whom the country stands indebted for so
noble an institution.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hall is 110 ft. in length, and 30 in width; an oblong of
the best proportions, in length, width, and height, befitting the
purposes of the Royal Institution.&nbsp; Wainscotting with
compartments rise to the sills of the windows, and is continued
to the high pace.&nbsp; At the entrance end, compartments also,
with a gallery supported by ornamented cantalivers; on the centre
of the gallery a large ornamental shield with the Royal Arms of
Charles II. most exquisitely carved.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Over the gallery is a large allegorical picture, painted by
Ward, representing Field Marshal the Duke of Wellington, in a
triumphal car, trampling upon the emblems of War, Anarchy, and
Rebellion, whilst Victory is crowning him, and Peace and her
attendant deities are following in her train.&nbsp; It was
purposely painted for the Hospital, and a present from the
British Institution.&nbsp; Concerts, in honour of Queen
Anne&rsquo;s coronation, were performed in the great Hall of the
Hospital, in the year 1702, under the direction of Mr. Abel,
singing master.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a statue of Charles II. in the centre of the square,
cast in bronze, in the garb of a Roman warrior, and facing the
north.&nbsp; It is said to be the production of Gibbons; but as a
mere work of art, it cannot be very highly commended.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>With respect to the lesser or flanking squares, they are given
up entirely to the lodgings of the officers of the establishment,
to public offices, including clerks&rsquo; chambers, board-room,
&amp;c., and, as has just been stated, to the accommodation of a
certain number of captains and light-horsemen.&nbsp; In both, the
buildings are lower and less solid than those which surround the
principal square.&nbsp; But the general character is the same
throughout.&nbsp; Brick walls, inlaid with a profusion of square
windows, all of them deep seated, and carefully touched in the
mouldings; free-stone finishings to each angle, gateways flanked
by free-stone pillars, and a roof universally high, and covered
with grey shining slate, point to a period when, in the
arrangement of such edifices, every approach to a classic model
was in this country carefully eschewed.</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Let
us return to a further description of the Hall, and also notice
some events which have taken place in it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Over the high table, and occupying the whole length of the
western face, is another painting, which was designed and begun
by Verrio, though finished by Henry Cook, representing Charles
II. on horseback, surrounded by groups of heathen gods, with a
distant view of Chelsea Hospital in the background.&nbsp; This
painting was the gift of one of the Earls of Ranelagh.&nbsp;
Flags and trophies, taken in battle, are suspended round the
hall.&nbsp; These occupy, in a double row, the spaces that
intervene between the windows, while in front of the music
gallery, elevated above a bundle of spear handles, waves the
Union jack.&nbsp; In the hall are double rows of tables,
generally covered, as if all the inhabitants of the pile took
here their meals; but the practice of dining together has long
since died out.&nbsp; Among the officers it ceased in 1796; among
the men some years previously.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Trial of General
Whitelocke</span>.&mdash;On Thursday, Jan. 30, 1808, this hall
was prepared for the trial of this officer.&nbsp; The charges
against him were in substance four, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Having, contrary to the tenor of instructions, in the
summons to Buenos Ayres, required that the civil officers and
magistrates should be prisoners.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Exposing the army, in marching against Buenos Ayres,
to a destructive discharge of musketry from the town.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Not being present personally on the advance against
Buenos Ayres.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Surrendering the Fortress of Monte Video without
necessity.</p>
<p>The Court, after having proceeded with the trial for several
days, allowed the General a week for his defence; and on the 24th
of March, the Secretary to H.R.H. the Commander-in-Chief
communicated officially to General Whitelocke the sentence of the
Court Martial, as approved by his Majesty, as
follows:&mdash;&ldquo;That the said Lieutenant-General Whitelocke
be cashiered, and declared totally unfit and unworthy to serve
his Majesty in any military capacity whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There have been two or three Courts of Inquiry, &amp;c.,
convened at subsequent periods, but they created nothing like the
interest that was shewn at the time of the above trial.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>The
remains of the late Duke of Wellington were laid in great state
in this hall for several days in September, 1852.&nbsp; Thousands
of persons from all parts of the country, as well as many
distinguished foreigners, came to witness the splendid but
mournful spectacle.&nbsp; Such exhibitions, however, seem rather
to belong to past ages than to the present period.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>From the Hall to the Chapel the visitor passes across a noble
vestibule lighted from above by a cupola, and which, besides
serving as a communication to both apartments, constitutes the
principal entrance into the Hospital itself.&nbsp; Over the altar
is a fresco painting, which represents the Resurrection of our
Saviour, sublimely described in the 28th chapter of St.
Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel.&nbsp; It is the production of Sebastian
Ricci.&nbsp; The chapel bears the same proportions as the dining
hall.&nbsp; It was consecrated by Dr. Compton, Bishop of London,
on the 13th of October, 1691.&nbsp; The service of plate, for the
use of the altar, was given by King James II.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first organ was the gift of Major Ingram; but, in 1817, a
new one was placed in the original case, built by Gray, at the
expense of four hundred guineas.&nbsp; It contained at that time
704 pipes with 12 pedal pipes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the chapel are deposited the standards of Tippoo Saib, the
whole of the eagles, thirteen in number, that were taken during
the war with France, &amp;c.&nbsp; Both the chapel and hall must
be visited to be fully appreciated, and this remark equally
applies to the different wards, the water-garden, and indeed
every part of this noble establishment.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Chelsea Hospital is, of course, designed to furnish an asylum
for those members of the regular army alone, whom wounds,
sickness, or old age, may have totally disabled.&nbsp; Its
inmates are therefore, in some way or other, invalids, that is to
say, men affected by some infirmity, which, though not visible to
the eye of the common spectator, is by the patient himself
abundantly felt.&nbsp; For the reception of those who require
admission into it, a spacious Infirmary has been erected, where
the aged patients receive the best medical treatment and every
requisite comfort.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Amongst the chaplains during this century may be mentioned the
Rev. W. Haggitt, M.A., the Rev. Richard Yates, D.D., the Rev. G.
R. Gleig, M.A., and the Rev. G. Matthias, M.A., who at the
present time holds the appointment.</p>
<h3><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>THE
HOSPITAL BURIAL GROUND, &amp;c.</h3>
<p>On the east side of the Hospital, adjoining Queen&rsquo;s Road
East, originally called Jews&rsquo; Row, is the cemetery,
formerly used for the interment of the officers and pensioners
belonging to the establishment.&nbsp; Near the entrance, on the
right, is the tomb of Simon Box, the first pensioner there buried
in 1692.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There is a very droll epitaph in this burial ground, to the
memory of William Hiseland, which states that &ldquo;when an
hundred years old he took unto him a wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
appears he had served in the army 80 years.&nbsp; He was born in
1620, and died in 1732, so that at his decease he was 112 years
old.&nbsp; A literary gentleman, referring to the above marriage,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, the centenarian wooer and antidiluvian
bridegroom&mdash;of what chronology was his bride?&nbsp; Let us
hope she was as silly at one end of the mortal story, as he was
in his second childhood, at the other!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In this ground was buried General Sir William Fawcett, K.B.,
Governor of the Hospital, who died in 1804, aged 76.&nbsp; His
remains were attended to the grave by the Prince of Wales, the
Dukes of York, Clarence, Kent, and Cambridge, and by several
noblemen and general officers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Although Dr. Monsey was not buried here, yet, as he died in
the Hospital, we must not omit to notice so remarkable a
character.&nbsp; Sir Robert Walpole assiduously cultivated his
acquaintance, and the celebrated Earl of Chesterfield
acknowledged with gratitude the benefits he had derived from his
medical assistance.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The character of Dr. Monsey, in point of natural humour, is
thought to have borne a near resemblance to that of Dean
Swift.&nbsp; His classical abilities were indeed enviable, and
his memory wonderfully retentive; insomuch that he was allowed to
be a storehouse of anecdote.&nbsp; The exuberance of his wit,
which, like the web of life, was of a mingled yarn, often
rendered his conversation exceedingly entertaining, sometimes
rather offensive, and at other times pointedly pathetic and
instructive.&nbsp; Sir Robert Walpole knew and valued the worth
of his &ldquo;Norfolk Doctor,&rdquo; as he called him; but though
he knew it, he neglected it.&nbsp; The Prime Minister was very
fond of billiards, at which his friend <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>very much
excelled him.&nbsp; &ldquo;How happens it,&rdquo; said Sir
Robert, in a social hour, &ldquo;that nobody will beat me at
billiards, or contradict me, but Dr. Monsey?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;They get places,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;I get a
dinner and praise.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following anecdote is very characteristic of the
Doctor&rsquo;s turn of temper, and is said to be well
attested.&nbsp; He lived so long in his office as physician to
Chelsea Hospital, that, during many changes of Administration,
the reversion of his place had been successively promised to
several medical friends of the Paymaster-General of the
Forces.&nbsp; Looking out of his window one day, and observing a
gentleman below, examining the hospital and gardens, who he knew
had secured the reversion of his place, the Doctor came down
stairs, and going out to him, accosted him
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Well, sir, I see you are examining your house
and garden, that <span class="GutSmall">ARE TO BE</span>, and I
will assure you they are both very pleasant and very
convenient.&nbsp; But I must tell you one circumstance&mdash;you
are the fifth man that has had the reversion of the place, and I
have buried them all.&nbsp; And what is more,&rdquo; continued
he, looking very scientifically at him, &ldquo;there is something
in your face that tells me I shall bury you too!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
event justified the prediction, for the gentleman died some years
after; and, what is still more extraordinary, at the time of the
Doctor&rsquo;s death there was not a person who seems to have
even solicited the promise of a reversion.&nbsp; He died in 1788,
aged 94.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On a table monument is an inscription to the memory of John
Wilson, Esq., Deputy Treasurer of Chelsea Hospital, and
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal Volunteers.&nbsp; He died of
apoplexy in 1812, aged 56.&nbsp; The monument was erected by the
officers of his regiment, as a token of their esteem.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Benjamin Moseley, M.D., thirty years physician to the
hospital, was buried here in 1819, aged 73.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>General Sir David Dundas, Governor of Chelsea Hospital, was
buried here in 1820.&nbsp; His funeral was attended by the Duke
of York, accompanied by his Staff.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Burial of a Female
Dragoon</span>.&mdash;Christiana Davis died at Chelsea in
1739.&nbsp; For several years she served as a dragoon,
undiscovered, in the Royal Irish Enniskillen Regiment; but
receiving a wound in her body she was then discovered, though her
comrades had not the least suspicion of her being a woman.&nbsp;
<a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>She
behaved with great valour afterwards in Flanders, and was very
useful in a battle to supply the soldiers with water and other
necessaries, even to the mouth of a cannon.&nbsp; She had an
allowance of one shilling per day, which she received till her
death.&nbsp; She was interred, according to her desire, amongst
the old pensioners, and three vollies were fired over her
grave.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Hannah Snell was also buried in this ground by her own
desire.&nbsp; She enlisted, in 1745, in Guise&rsquo;s Regiment of
Foot, in which she served for some time, but deserted and
enlisted in the Marines.&nbsp; She was severely wounded, and, on
her recovery, sent to England.&nbsp; Her heroic conduct procured
for her an annual pension of &pound;30 for life.&nbsp; She also
procured a pension from Chelsea Hospital, and after her discharge
continued to wear her uniform.&nbsp; At length this poor creature
became insane, and was placed in Bethlehem Hospital, where she
died.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Charles Burney, Mus.D., author of the History of Music,
&amp;c., was buried here in 1814, aged 88; he was organist at
Chelsea Hospital, and father of Madame D&rsquo;Arblay, the
authoress of Evelina, Cecilia, and Camilla.&nbsp; She was also
for many years the organist.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Many a distinguished officer and old veteran have been
interred in this ground.&nbsp; Amongst the pensioners some have
lived to a great age.&nbsp; Thomas Asbey, buried in 1737, aged
112.&mdash;John Rogers, 1764, aged 103.&mdash;Robert Cumming,
1767, aged 116.&mdash;Peter Dowling, 1768, aged 102.&mdash;Peter
Burnet, 1773, aged 107.&mdash;Joshua Cueman, 1794, it is stated,
aged 123.&mdash;Richard Swifield, 1805, aged 105.&mdash;Abraham
Moss, 1805, aged 106.&mdash;John Wolf, 1821, aged 107.&mdash;John
Salter, 1827, aged 104.&nbsp; I have frequently conversed with
the latter centenarian.&nbsp; In his youth he must have been a
fine-built man, standing upwards of six feet high.&nbsp; He might
often be seen, even within a short time of his death, sweeping
away the autumn leaves in the walks of the hospital grounds, as a
matter of choice.&nbsp; Such a circumstance suggests many serious
reflections, which I leave to the reader to supply.&nbsp; There
is also said to be an inmate at the present time, aged 106.</p>
<h3>OLD RANELAGH GARDENS.</h3>
<p>Adjoining the Royal Hospital, on the eastern side, stood the
mansion of Richard, Earl of Ranelagh.&nbsp; This nobleman, about
<a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the year
1690, obtained from the Crown a large grant of land; he built a
house thereon, and made it his principal residence till his death
in 1712.&nbsp; In 1730 an Act was passed vesting this estate in
trustees, and three years after the house and premises were sold
in lots.&nbsp; About this period, Lacy, the patentee of Drury
Lane Theatre, projected a plan for establishing a place of public
entertainment on a large and splendid scale; and, in pursuance of
this scheme, he took a lease of these premises.&nbsp; But it
appears he soon gave up the undertaking, as in 1741, when the
Rotunda was built, there were two other lessees, one of whom
became a bankrupt.&nbsp; The property was then divided into 36
shares of &pound;1000 each, the greater number of which were held
by Sir Thomas Robinson, who built for himself a house adjoining
to Ranelagh Gardens.&nbsp; Several of his friends took shares in
the concern, and it became for a time prosperous.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rotunda was opened with a public breakfast, &amp;c., in
1742.&nbsp; It was an imitation of the Pantheon at Rome.&nbsp;
The external diameter was 185 ft., the internal 150 ft.&nbsp; The
entrances were by four Doric porticos opposite each other, and
the first story was rustic; round the whole, on the outside, was
an arcade, and over it a gallery, the stairs to which were at the
porticos.&nbsp; The interior was fitted up with great taste, and
from the ceiling descended 28 chandeliers, in two circles.&nbsp;
Music and dancing were the principal attractions.&nbsp; From the
branches of the trees that shaded every walk festoons of coloured
lamps hung down.&nbsp; Royalty, nobility, and gentry visited
it.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Presentation of Colours to the Chelsea
Volunteers</span>.</h3>
<p>On the 4th of January, 1804, a brilliant scene was displayed
at Ranelagh, on the presentation of Colours to the Chelsea Royal
Volunteers.&nbsp; About noon the trumpet announced the arrival of
the Courtly party in three of his Majesty&rsquo;s carriages,
followed by others belonging to different noblemen.&nbsp; The
company having alighted, Lady Harrington was conducted to her box
by the Vice-Chamberlain.&nbsp; The Countess being seated two
pairs of Colours were introduced, and placed on each side of the
royal box.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Colours of each regiment
consisted of a plain Union standard, but the regimental one,
which was designed and executed by the Queen and Princesses, was
a superb piece of needlework, the ground being a rich purple
silk, having in the centre his Majesty&rsquo;s arms, embroidered
and surrounded with sprigs of variegated tints and figures.&nbsp;
At the lower corners were the letters &ldquo;C. R.,&rdquo; and
under the <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>armorial bearings the words, &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Royal
Volunteers.&rdquo; <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; After
prayers and a suitable discourse, Lady Harrington thus addressed
the officers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&mdash;Her Majesty having been
graciously pleased to confer upon me the honour of presenting to
you these Colours, I am anxious to express how highly I am
flattered by this distinguished mark of the Queen&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; At a time of all others the most awful, when our
country is threatened with the unprovoked attack of a most
implacable enemy, and when you have evinced your readiness to
stand forward in the defence of everything that is most dear to
us all, what can be more gratifying to you than being so
particularly distinguished by her Majesty, and receiving your
Colours from her?&nbsp; Animated as your hearts must be in
gratitude to the Queen, in addition to every other noble
sentiment that has guided you, from the moment of the first offer
of your services, it would not only be superfluous, but
presumptuous in me, to add anything more upon the occasion than
the expression of every fervent wish for your success in the
event of the enemy carrying his threats into execution; confident
that no power, however strenuously exerted, will ever wrest these
Colours from you while there is yet left a man in your corps to
defend them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this speech a suitable answer was made by Lord Hobart, who
expressed, in behalf of the corps, the most patriotic and
grateful sentiments.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Subsequent Directors turned Ranelagh into mere Assembly and
Concert Rooms, and the gardens for a display of fire-works.&nbsp;
It soon ceased to be an attractive promenade, and the brilliant
display of beauty it had made for years was seen no more.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In 1805 an order was made for taking down Ranelagh House,
which had been the residence of Sir Thomas Robinson, and the
Rotunda.&nbsp; The furniture was sold by auction, and the entire
buildings.&nbsp; General Wilford became the purchaser of a
portion of the land, on which he erected a large house, and
resided in it for many years.&nbsp; The ruins of some of the
original buildings belonging to Ranelagh Gardens remained for a
considerable time afterwards.&nbsp; In the front of General
Wilford&rsquo;s house, on the north, some excellent cricket
matches were played, for Chelsea then abounded with first-rate
cricketers.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>At
length the Crown purchased General Wilford&rsquo;s house and the
land adjoining it, whereon the Rotunda formerly stood, for the
use of Chelsea Hospital, and when Lord John Russell (now Earl
Russell) became Paymaster-General, he caused the Ranelagh field,
which was near the river, to be laid out into portions or lots,
for the old men to occupy, each as his private garden.&nbsp; The
remaining portion of the land of Ranelagh, on the east, has since
been added to the Hospital Gardens, and presents one of the most
picturesque specimens of gardening in the vicinity of
London.&nbsp; To these gardens the public have free access.&nbsp;
Along the side of them there is an excellent road leading to the
Suspension Bridge, and on the opposite side a splendid range of
Barracks erected within the last few years.</p>
<h3>THE ORIGINAL CHELSEA BUNHOUSE.</h3>
<p>Chelsea was famous for its buns from the commencement of the
last century.&nbsp; Swift, who lodged in Church Lane (street),
and used to walk to and from town, &ldquo;two good miles, and
just 5748 steps,&rdquo; writes to Stella, in 1712, &ldquo;Pray,
are not they fine buns sold here in our town? * * * Was it not
r-r-r-r-r-r rare Chelsea buns?&nbsp; I bought one in my
walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; This old bunhouse was a rather long building
of one storey, with a colonnade in front, projecting over the
pavement, the dwelling-house attached to it standing in the rear,
with a large and well-kept garden behind it.&nbsp; It was
situated in what was called Grosvenor Row, known as such at the
time the bunhouse was pulled down, the site of which is a little
eastward beyond the boundary line of this parish, and not far
distant from Chelsea Hospital.&nbsp; George II. and Queen
Caroline, and the princesses, bought buns here; as did George
III. and Queen Charlotte, who presented to the proprietor a
silver half gallon mug, and five guineas in it.&nbsp; Here, on
Good Friday morning, &pound;250 has been taken for buns; and so
lately as 1839 no less than 240,000 buns were sold here on Good
Friday.&nbsp; This may appear to many an incredulous number; but
few persons at the present time can form an adequate idea of the
immense demand for them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. J. B. Owen, of St. Jude&rsquo;s, Chelsea, in one of
his admirable lectures, delivered in 1860, humourously observed,
&ldquo;There is no poetry more delicate, nor was street music
more <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>popular, than the old bellman&rsquo;s
cry&mdash;&lsquo;Smoking hot, piping hot, Chelsea
buns!&rsquo;&nbsp; Picture the enthusiasm of a local rhymer thus
immortalising the article:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O flour of the ovens! a zephyr in paste!<br />
Fragrant as honey, and sweeter in taste!<br />
Hail to the bellman, who sings as he runs,<br />
&lsquo;Smoking hot, piping hot, Chelsea buns!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As flaky and white as if baked by the light,<br />
As the flesh of an infant, soft, doughy, and slight;<br />
The public devour thee like Goths and Huns,<br />
&lsquo;Smoking hot, piping hot, Chelsea buns!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prelates, and princes, and lieges, and kings,<br />
Hail for the bellman, who tinkles and sings,<br />
Bouche of the highest and lowliest ones,<br />
&lsquo;Smoking hot, piping hot, Chelsea buns!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Like the home of your birth, or the scent of a flower,<br />
Or the blush of the morning on field or bower,<br />
There&rsquo;s a charm in the sound which nobody shuns,<br />
Of &lsquo;Smoking hot, piping hot, Chelsea buns!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bunhouse had become so famous, not only throughout
London, but for several miles round it, that not to visit Chelsea
on Good Friday, and purchase some of the &ldquo;rare buns,&rdquo;
was considered as unaccountable amongst a certain
class&mdash;such as the servants of the nobility and gentry,
shopmen, mechanics, and apprentices&mdash;as it would have been
for them to acknowledge that they had never heard of Greenwich
Fair.&nbsp; But this part of Chelsea, and the adjoining
&ldquo;Five Fields,&rdquo; now Eaton and Belgrave Squares,
actually did represent a minor Greenwich Fair.&nbsp; From my own
personal observation I should say, provided the weather was
favourable, there were generally on Good Fridays nearly 200,000
persons collected in the immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp; It was a
fair to all intents and purposes.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Five
Fields&rdquo; there were drinking booths, swings, gingerbread
stalls, nine-pins being played, gaming, and all the other vicious
&ldquo;entertainments&rdquo; which annually disgraced the
metropolis in former times.&nbsp; Such was the pressure of the
immense crowd at the bunhouse, from about three o&rsquo;clock in
the morning till five in the afternoon, that the only mode of
supplying the demand for buns was by obtaining them through
apertures in the shutters.&nbsp; The bunhouse, however, was very
respectably conducted, and such scenes as I have described were
only to be <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>witnessed on the day previously named&mdash;a day set
apart to commemorate the most momentous event, as regards its
consequences, in the history of the world.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There were many things very attractive at the original
bunhouse.&nbsp; In it was a collection of pictures, models,
grotesque, figures, and modern antiques.&nbsp; In a conspicuous
position were two leaden figures of grenadiers of 1745; a plaster
figure of William, Duke of Cumberland; a painting of the King and
Queen seated; a model of the bunhouse, and of the exploits of a
bottle conjurer.&nbsp; This celebrated building was pulled down
some years since, and with it the olden charm fled.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having thus arrived at the eastern boundary of the parish, I
trace my steps through Queen&rsquo;s Road East, formerly called
Jews&rsquo; Row.&nbsp; Many years ago this road, for scenes of
depravity, was as bad as any part of the East end of London; but
it happily was confined to this limited locality, and arose from
the circumstance that the Out-Pensioners from nearly all parts of
the country had to come to Chelsea Hospital to receive their
pensions, and disabled soldiers to pass the Board, &amp;c.,
previously to being discharged from the army.&nbsp; The
Government at length wisely altered the arrangement for paying
the Out-Pensioners, and they now receive their pensions in
districts nearer to where they dwell, which prevents their being
put to the expense of coming to London, being robbed by
&ldquo;sharpers,&rdquo; or beset by prostitution.&nbsp;
Jews&rsquo; Row, and its former scenes, comparatively speaking,
have passed away, and what remains of vice and crime, in some of
the crammed courts leading from it to Turks&rsquo; Row, is
gradually disappearing, through the exertions of the Rev. J. B.
Owen, M.A., of St. Jude&rsquo;s Church, the District Visitors,
and other agencies.&nbsp; These courts will probably be cleared
away before many years have elapsed, and Queen&rsquo;s Road East
will then become one of the leading and most attractive
thoroughfares in the parish of Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One very great improvement took place some few years
since.&nbsp; The Burial Ground was enclosed by a high
dismal-looking old wall, which was pulled down, and a new one
built, not more than three feet high, on which a neat
iron-railing is placed, thus removing much vice and preventing
many robberies, and rendering the road perfectly safe.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>In
the year 1793 a horrible murder was committed in a house fronting
the North Court of the Royal Hospital.&nbsp; The victims were Mr.
Silva and Mary Williams, his servant.&nbsp; It appears to have
been perpetrated in the morning, between half-past eight and
twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>George Saunders, at the inquest, stated that when the alarm
was given he entered the house, and, on lifting up the servant,
Mary Williams, there were signs of life, but she expired in two
or three minutes.&nbsp; Mr. Silva was alive, but speechless, and
died shortly afterwards.&nbsp; He found in a closet in the
kitchen two iron chests, unlocked, and empty.&nbsp; In the front
room, one pair of stairs, a bureau open, with the drawers out,
and the papers in confusion, and on the floor a quantity of
bedding, folded up.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. North, surgeon, gave a fearful account of the wounds
received, and the jury, after a lengthened investigation, found a
verdict of wilful murder by persons unknown.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A nephew of Mr. Silva was taken up on suspicion, and examined
at Bow Street.&nbsp; He shewed, by respectable evidence, that he
was at home when the murder was committed, and was
discharged.&nbsp; This person, however, afterwards committed
suicide, and he was buried in the highway at Chelsea, leaving
great doubts of his innocency of the crime.</p>
<h3>Royal Military Asylum.</h3>
<p>On the site of the Royal Military Asylum stood a capital
mansion, the residence for many years of the Cadogan family, and
afterwards the property of Sir Walter Farquhar, Bart., of whom it
was purchased for the purpose of erecting the present
Institution.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Royal Military Asylum for the children of soldiers of the
regular army is situated near the Royal Hospital, on the north
east.&nbsp; It was built by Mr. Copland, from the designs of Mr.
Sanders.&nbsp; On the 19th of June, 1801, the first stone of this
structure was laid by the Duke of York, accompanied by many
general officers, and a considerable number of the
nobility.&nbsp; The motives which gave rise to the establishment,
and the principles <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>upon which it is founded, are alike honourable to the
present enlightened age, and congenial with the soundest maxims
of policy, humanity, and benevolence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The necessity
of such an Institution will appear obvious,&rdquo; says Mr.
Faulkner, &ldquo;when we consider the helpless and forlorn
condition of many among these orphan objects of commiseration,
who in this comfortable asylum are clothed, have good wholesome
food, acquire a decent education, are taught the principles of
Christianity, and, finally, are made useful in whatever course of
life they may be enabled to adopt.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The ground in front of this spacious building is laid out in
grass plots and gravel walks, and planted with trees.&nbsp; The
edifice forms three sides of a quadrangle; it is built of brick,
with an elegant stone balustrade in the centre of the western
front, which is ornamented with a noble portico of the Doric
order, consisting of four columns, which support a large and
well-proportioned pediment.&nbsp; On the frieze is the following
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;The Royal Military Asylum for the
Children of Soldiers of the Regular Army.&rdquo;&nbsp; Over it
are the Imperial arms.&nbsp; The north and south wings are joined
to the principal front by a colonade, which forms a good shelter
for the boys in wet weather.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The vestibule is in the centre of the grand front.&nbsp; On
the left and right are the dining halls, 80 ft. long and 30 ft.
wide.&nbsp; Over these are the schoolrooms, of the same
dimensions.&nbsp; The committee-room is over the vestibule.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The north wing contains the apartments of the Commandant,
Surgeon, Quartermaster, and dormitories for the boys; the south
wing, apartments for the Adjutant and Secretary, the Masters of
the Normal and Model Schools, and dormitories.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the south of the grounds stands the Normal School of the
Royal Military Asylum, in which reside the Students who are being
trained for Schoolmasters in Her Majesty&rsquo;s army.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chapel was consecrated in 1824, and is calculated to
contain the whole of the establishment, with accommodation for
upwards of 100 visitors.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The girls were removed to Southampton in 1823, and the boys in
that institution removed to Chelsea, so that now the latter
contains only boys, and the former only girls.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>On
the 20th of June, 1805, George III., the Queen, with the
Princesses and Royal Dukes, visited the R.M. Asylum.&nbsp; They
inspected several of the apartments, dining hall, &amp;c., and
his Majesty said it was one of the best institutions in the
country.&nbsp; This was a regular gala day for the children.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands paid a visit to the
Royal Military Asylum in the year 1824.&nbsp; Their Majesties
were attended by Major-General Sir Willoughby Gordon, and
appeared much delighted with the establishment, the nature of
which was explained to them by the interpreter.&nbsp; They were
received by the full band playing &ldquo;God save the
King,&rdquo; and were highly gratified with the skill of the
juvenile musicians.&nbsp; After having seen the children at
dinner, their Majesties witnessed the various gymnastic
exercises, and at their departure were saluted by the hearty
cheers of the youthful regiment, which was drawn up before
them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>His late Royal Highness the Duke of York was the founder of
this Institution, and constantly bestowed his best exertions in
promoting the welfare, and increasing the comforts, of the
helpless inmates nurtured within its walls.&nbsp; On his last
visit, the children crowded round their benefactor, and gave him
three hearty cheers.&nbsp; Such was the effect produced by it
that the Duke could not refrain from shedding tears; and, patting
the head of the foremost boy, he ejaculated, as he passed down
the steps, &ldquo;God bless you, my lads.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the 7th of January, 1827, a sermon was preached by the Rev.
G. Clark, M.A., chaplain, on the demise of the Royal Founder, at
the conclusion of which he thus addressed the
children:&mdash;&ldquo;I need not tell you that it has pleased
Almighty God to take away from this world the President of this
Institution, the Duke of York.&nbsp; He was the firm friend of
your fathers, and also a kind and steady friend to you, their
children.&nbsp; Whatever advantages you enjoy in this Asylum, you
owe, under Divine Providence, to the Duke of York.&nbsp; He was
the founder of this Institution, and by his recommendations and
exertions it was begun and completed.&nbsp; Many of you will
remember this good friend who is now taken from us.&nbsp; A few
months ago you beheld him walk through your ranks; you saw in his
countenance the pleasure he felt from witnessing the healthy and
creditable appearance of so many children of British
soldiers.&nbsp; I exhort you to hold his memory in your hearts
and affections; <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>show your gratitude by improving the advantages he has
given to you in this Asylum, and by doing your duty to God and
man when you go forth into the world.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The following tribute to the memory of the Duke of York was
written by Dr. Veitch, at that time physician to the Chelsea
Dispensary:&mdash;&ldquo;The knowledge which his late Royal
Highness possessed of human nature, and what was becoming the
character of British soldiers, induced him to impress on their
minds a system of discipline at once correct and conveying lofty
feelings; so that men thus trained were at all times ready to
prefer death to subjugation.&nbsp; We may here say, with truth,
that to the love of his country and the army he has prematurely
fallen a victim.&nbsp; No self-gratification, no pleasures, were
ever by him allowed to interfere with the duties he owed to the
army and his country, and however late his hour of going to rest,
he was invariably the first man at his post in the morning.&nbsp;
We find individuals who are distinguished as statesmen, as
admirals, as generals, but who are without the smallest
pretensions to true greatness, because their talents and their
courage are not blended with the chivalrous, the gallant, and
finer inspirations flowing from the heart.&nbsp; Such men are
generally anxious enough that their services should be
appreciated by their Sovereign, while they overlook what they owe
to others who have mainly contributed to their fame and to their
fortune.&nbsp; The late illustrious Duke had no such narrowness;
his soul was surrounded with generous and delicate attributes,
rendering all periods of his splendid career utterly inaccessible
to deeds of darkness, and also ever ready to expand to the light
of truth, to the claims of justice and of humanity; and he is
therefore eminently entitled to the character of a great man;
because his high attainments in military affairs were combined
with an exalted and refined sense of courage and of
honour.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lieutenant-Colonel George Williamson, the first Commandant of
the Royal Military Asylum, died Sept. 6, 1812, and his remains
were interred in the Burial Ground of the Royal Hospital on the
11th of that month.&nbsp; In consequence of the respect in which
his memory was held by his Royal Highness the Commander in Chief,
and the Commissioners of the Asylum, it was determined that he
should be honoured with a military funeral; and his body was
followed to the grave by the above-mentioned royal and
illustrious personages.&nbsp; The procession was received, at the
front entrance of the Royal Hospital, by the officers of that
establishment, and conducted by the chaplains <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to the
Chapel, where the funeral service was read by the Rev. G. Clark,
and several psalms were sung by the children.&nbsp; The body was
then carried to the burial ground in the same order, and the
remaining part of the ceremony performed; the Duke of York, the
Commissioners, officers, and children of the Institution,
surrounding the grave.&nbsp; The whole was conducted with the
greatest order and solemnity, and presented a very impressive
scene.&nbsp; Since the erection of the Chapel, a handsome
monument has been placed therein to the memory of this
meritorious officer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>About the year 1810 part of the glebe opposite to the Royal
Military Asylum was purchased, under the authority of an Act of
Parliament, for the use of this Institution; and other land, at
Merton, in Surrey, was bought with the money as glebe to the
Rectory of Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In concluding this brief description of the Royal Military
Asylum, it may justly be observed that the contemplation of such
a noble fabric is calculated to excite the liveliest emotions of
gratitude for having been born in a country which abounds with
charitable institutions.&nbsp; To the soldier it must continually
afford the most pleasing prospects for the comfort and support of
his infant children, and it will induce him to serve, if
possible, with greater confidence and energy, feeling assured
that if he falls in battle his country has provided a home for
his helpless children.</p>
<h3>ST. JUDE&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>This Church is situated in Turks&rsquo; Row, almost adjoining
the extreme southern side of the Royal Military Asylum.&nbsp; The
first stone of the edifice was laid in August, 1843, and it was
consecrated and opened for Divine Service in June, 1844.&nbsp;
The Rev. John Patterson, M.A., was the first Incumbent, and on
his leaving Chelsea, the Rev. Shadwell Morley Barkworth, M.A.,
succeeded him.&nbsp; The present Incumbent is the Rev. J. B.
Owen, M.A., who has laboured most zealously in the District some
years.&nbsp; To his indefatigable exertions, and to the
visitations of the District Visitors, &amp;c., connected with the
Church, much of the demoralization which generally prevailed in
the numerous <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>crowded courts, lying between Turks&rsquo; Row and
Queen&rsquo;s Road East, has been removed.&nbsp; Attached to the
Church are National, Free, and Infant Schools, each of which are
very well attended.&nbsp; A portion of the children belonging to
the Hans Town Industrial School are here accommodated with
sittings.&nbsp; The Church will hold about 900 persons.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Proceeding in an easterly direction we arrive at what was
formerly known as White Lion Street.&nbsp; Here very considerable
improvements have been effected.&nbsp; The whole of one side of
this street has been pulled down, by which means there is now a
good road from the Suspension Bridge to Knightsbridge.</p>
<h3>CHELSEA CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>This Chapel was erected in 1865, and is situated on a part of
the site we have just described, adjoining Lower Sloane
Street.&nbsp; The Church worshipping within its sacred walls
formerly occupied Paradise Chapel, Queen&rsquo;s Road West, which
still remains, and which was originally a school room belonging
to a scholastic establishment, which occupied for many years the
site of Calthorpe Place.&nbsp; It is still retained by the
members of the above Church as a Ragged School.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chapel is a plain white brick building, without any
particular attempt at architectural display.&nbsp; Mr. James
Cubitt was the architect.&nbsp; It will seat probably 1000
persons.&nbsp; There is a schoolroom underneath the Chapel, which
will contain about 600 adults, in which there is a Day School for
Girls and Infants in the week, and the Sunday School is also held
in it, which numbers about 200.&nbsp; The Rev. Frank H. White,
who resides in Hemus Terrace, is the Minister, and is much
esteemed not only by the members of the church, but by all with
whom he is associated in life.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I must now proceed to Sloane Street, where first &ldquo;I drew
the breath of life,&rdquo; and which is consequently endeared to
me by recollections of the very earliest events of my life.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Mr.
Holland, in the year 1777, took a lease of one hundred acres of
land, called in old records Blacklands, of Charles, Lord Cadogan,
which now consists of Sloane Street, Cadogan Place, Hans Place,
Exeter Street, Ellis Street, D&rsquo;Oyley Street, Sloane Square,
George Street, &amp;c.&nbsp; The buildings were begun just at the
commencement of the American war, owing to which their progress
was much impeded.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A very great improvement has at last been made at Grosvenor
Bridge, in ancient times called Blandel Bridge.&nbsp; Its name
was probably corrupted to &ldquo;Bloody Bridge,&rdquo; in
consequence of the numbers of robberies and murders formerly
committed on this spot.&nbsp; The entrance here into the parish,
at the eastern end of Sloane Square, has been after years of
delay considerably widened, and some spacious shops
erected.&nbsp; There is also now an Underground Railway Station,
and the West London Commercial Bank has likewise extensive
premises in Sloane Square, both of which will confer very great
advantages on the inhabitants of Chelsea, and the public in
general.</p>
<h3>Trinity Church, Upper Chelsea.</h3>
<p>This Church is situated at the south end of Sloane Street,
near Sloane Square.&nbsp; It is a brick structure of Gothic
architecture, the western front consisting of a centre flanked by
two wide towers rising to a level with the roof, and terminating
with lofty octagonal spires.&nbsp; A large entrance door occupies
the space from tower to tower to the height of the first
division, giving access both to nave and aisles, over which
stands a large window separated by two mullions, with trefoil
headings slightly ornamented; above this is placed a circular
stone surrounded by tracery, intended, probably, at some future
period for a clock.&nbsp; The towers to the first blocking course
are plain, but above they are enriched with trefoil-headed
windows, divided into two compartments, slender buttresses
separating the towers octagonally to the summit, crowned by a
battlement and surmounted by obtuse-headed pinnacles.&nbsp; At
each side of the centre great door there is a smaller one for
ingress and egress to the aisles and galleries.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>The
interior of the Church presents no peculiar feature requiring
special notice, at the same time it possesses in its design all
that is essential to impress the mind with the sacred character
of the edifice.&nbsp; Those who are unable to pay for a sitting
have comfortable free seats provided for them.&nbsp; The Church
will probably accommodate 1500 persons.&nbsp; Attached to it, on
the right, is a spacious schoolroom, designed to correspond with
the architecture of the exterior of the Church.&nbsp; The whole
of the schools are very well attended.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The late Rev. H. Blunt, M.A., was the first Incumbent, and
when he resigned the Rev. Richard Burgess, B.D., the present
Rector of the Church, succeeded him.&nbsp; Trinity Church, from
its consecration in 1830, has always been very numerously
attended.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the Church are several tablets, amongst them is one to the
memory of the Rev. H. Blunt.</p>
<h3>SLOANE TERRACE WESLEYAN CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>This Chapel was built in 1811.&nbsp; It is a neat and
substantial edifice.&nbsp; The galleries extend round three sides
of the interior, and the whole will accommodate about 1200
persons.&nbsp; The erection of this place of worship is to be
attributed to the liberality of several beneficent gentlemen,
among whom may be especially mentioned Joseph Butterworth, Esq.,
who, at that time, had summer apartments in Chelsea.&nbsp; The
attention of these Christian friends had been arrested by
observing a large number of the middling and poorer classes, in
the vicinity of Jews&rsquo; Row, wandering about upon the
mornings of the Sabbath.&nbsp; They accordingly took a large
room, or small chapel, at nearly the end of George Street, and
subsequently erected Sloane Terrace Chapel.&nbsp; The
congregation and the members rapidly increased, and at various
times many alterations have been made so as to render the chapel
and schoolrooms more commodious.&nbsp; It is a pleasing thought,
that, amidst a vast amount of Sabbath desecration, there is not a
Church or Chapel in the parish, where the Sabbath School is not
well attended.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Nearly opposite to Sloane Terrace, in Sloane Street,
resided for many years H. W. Burgess, Esq., a most accomplished
artist.&nbsp; His gentlemanly deportment and piety endeared him
to a large circle of friends.&nbsp; There was scarcely a
benevolent society in the parish to which he was not a
contributor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Thomas Hoblyn, Esq., who for many years was the Rector&rsquo;s
Churchwarden at St. Luke&rsquo;s Parish Church, occupied a house
at the corner of Cadogan Street, Sloane Street.&nbsp; He was one
of several newly-appointed magistrates, about the time of the
passing of the first Local Act of Parliament for the better
assessing and collecting the Poor&rsquo;s Rate, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The above house is now occupied as an Industrial Home for
Girls, one of the many admirable institutions which reflect so
much credit upon that part of Chelsea.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Captain G. Bague, R.N., resided also in Sloane Street, nearly
opposite Cadogan Place, for a long period.&nbsp; He was made a
magistrate for the county at the same time as Mr. Hoblyn.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The late Rev. H. Blunt, M.A., resided for a considerable time
in Sloane Street.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The late Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Bart., resided for some
years at 72, Sloane Street.&nbsp; He died in 1869, at St.
Petersburgh, after a short illness, which unexpectedly proved
fatal, at the age of 58.&nbsp; He was born in London in 1810, was
the only son of the late Mr. Charles Wentworth Dilke, chief
proprietor and at one time editor of the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
newspaper, and subsequently the manager of the <i>Daily News</i>,
and who died about eight years ago.&nbsp; His mother was Maria,
daughter of Mr. E. Walker.&nbsp; He was educated at Westminster
School, and subsequently at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he
took his degree in Law instead of Arts.&nbsp; In early life he
was associated with the literary labours of his father, whom he
largely aided by his cultivated tastes, his wide range of
information, sound judgment, and habits of business.&nbsp; He was
one of the earliest promoters of the first Great Exhibition, and,
indeed, acted as the leading member of the Executive
Committee.&nbsp; The fact of his occupying such a position
naturally brought Mr. Dilke into close and frequent contact with
the late Prince Consort, who was much struck with the ability he
displayed, and at whose suggestion the honour of knighthood was
offered to him in recognition of his services.&nbsp; That honour,
however, he declined; and with it <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>refused all pecuniary remuneration,
wishing his services to be purely honorary.&nbsp; Her Majesty,
however, resolved that he should not be wholly unrewarded, sent
to Mrs. Dilke a handsome diamond-bracelet, which, no doubt, will
become an heirloom in the Dilke family.&nbsp; Mr. Dilke was also
associated with the second Great Exhibition as one of the five
Royal Commissioners appointed by Her Majesty.&nbsp; It has always
been understood also that the resuscitation of the Royal
Horticultural Society of London has been in a very great measure
due to his exertions as one of the most active of its
vice-presidents.&nbsp; It will be remembered that almost
immediately after the death of the Prince Consort Her Majesty was
pleased to confer a baronetcy on Mr. Dilke in recognition of the
Prince&rsquo;s friendship and personal regard for him.&nbsp; Sir
Charles Wentworth Dilke sat in the last Parliament in the Liberal
interest for Wallingford, defeating Mr. Serjeant Malins (who has
since attained the Judicial Bench), but he lost his seat at the
last general election.&nbsp; The late baronet, who was a
magistrate for Westminster and for the county of Middlesex,
married in 1840 Mary, a daughter of Captain Chatfield, but was
left a widower a few years ago.&nbsp; By her he has left a son,
born in 1843, Mr. (now Sir) Charles Wentworth Dilke, of Trinity
Hall, Cambridge, who was returned at the last election as one of
the members, in the Liberal interest, for the newly-enfranchised
constituency of Chelsea, and another son, Mr. Ashton Wentworth
Dilke, born 1850.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The present Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Bart., M.P., resides
at his late father&rsquo;s house in Sloane Street.&nbsp; He has
extensively travelled in America, and has published a very
interesting work, entitled &ldquo;Greater Britain,&rdquo; and is
the author of several pamphlets on social and political
topics.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">The Pavilion, Hans Place</span>.&mdash;A
few particulars respecting this once beautiful estate will no
doubt be interesting to many of the readers of this work.&nbsp;
When Mr. Holland took the lease of the land, formerly known as
&ldquo;Blacklands,&rdquo; now Upper Chelsea, he reserved to
himself 21 acres of it, on which he built an elegant house for
his own residence.&nbsp; This was called the Pavilion, and it was
purchased of Mr. Holland&rsquo;s executors by Peter Denys, Esq.,
and became afterwards the property of his relict, the Right Hon.
Lady Charlotte Denys, who resided in it with her family for some
years afterwards.&nbsp; It consisted of three sides of a
quadrangle, open to the north, and the approach was from Hans
Place.&nbsp; The house was superbly furnished.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>In
the library, on two mahogany pedestals, stood two busts in
statuary marble of Pitt and Fox, by Nollekens.&nbsp; In the
dining room were two excellent pictures by Fuseli; one a vision
of Lady Jane Grey, before her execution, from a manuscript letter
of Bishop Latimer to Dr. Bullinger; the other a scene from the
tragedy of King Lear.&nbsp; To which might be added many others
of equal worth.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The south front faced an extensive and beautifully-planted
lawn, gently rising to the level of the colonnade and principal
floor.&nbsp; This front was originally built as a model for the
Pavilion at Brighton, and was ornamented by a colonnade of the
Doric order, extending the whole length of the building.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the west side of the lawn was an Ice-house, round which was
erected an admirable representation of the ruins of an ancient
Priory, in which the appearance of age and decay was strikingly
faithful.&nbsp; The Gothic stone-work was brought from the
ancient demolished residence of Cardinal Wolsey, at Esher, in
Surrey.&nbsp; The lawn was ornamented by a fine sheet of water,
which produced a most pleasing effect.&nbsp; The Priory displayed
considerable variety of fanciful intricate paths and scenery,
profusely ornamented with shrubs, and had a private communication
with the house by the walks of the shrubbery.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lady Charlotte Denys gave annually a treat to the children of
the &ldquo;Hans Town Schools,&rdquo; &amp;c., and had booths
erected in which they partook of tea, whilst others contained
fruit and playthings to amuse them.&nbsp; On these occasions the
inhabitants were admitted to witness the pleasing juvenile
scene.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Hans Place, Sloane
Street</span>.&mdash;Miss Landon (L.E.L.) was born in &ldquo;snug
Hans Place&rdquo; in 1802, and spent the greater portion of her
life in it.&nbsp; She went to school at No. 22, kept by Miss
Rowden, who published &ldquo;A Poetical Introduction to the Study
of Botany,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pleasures of Friendship,&rdquo;
and at length became the Countess of St. Queutin.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the inmates of the same house have been Lady Caroline
Lamb, who married the Hon. W. Lamb, afterwards Viscount
Melbourne, Miss Mitford, Lady Bulwer, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, the talented artistes, resided for
some time in Hans Place.</p>
<h3><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>ST.
SAVIOUR&rsquo;S CHURCH.</h3>
<p>This Church is situated a little to the north of Hans Place,
and near to Walton Street.&nbsp; The exterior has no particular
pretensions to architectural display.&nbsp; The interior is neat,
and possesses a greater degree of architectural design.&nbsp; It
will seat probably more than 1000 persons.&nbsp; The Rev. W.
Niven, M.A., was the first Incumbent, and retained it until
recently, when the Rev. George Weldon, M.A., succeeded him.&nbsp;
Of Mr. Niven it may justly be said that he was zealous and
faithful, kind to the poor, and respected by all classes.&nbsp;
There are excellent schools and many charitable societies which
are liberally supported by the contributions of the
congregation.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Cadogan Place</span>.&mdash;These capital
houses were principally erected by Mr. W. Whitehead, sen., on
part of the land leased originally to Mr. Holland, as previously
mentioned.&nbsp; Amongst the residents at different periods may
be selected the names of Capt. Acklom, R.N.; Thomas Bryan, Esq.;
W. B. France, Esq.; each of whom were made magistrates for the
county at the same time as Mr. Hoblyn and Capt. Bague; C.
Hopkinson, Esq.; H. Warburton, Esq., M.P.; Sir William Clay,
M.P.; Dr. Veitch; the Rev. Richard Burgess, and the Rev. J. B.
Owen.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In Little Cadogan Place Mr. William Whitehead, jun., lived for
a great many years.&nbsp; He was an extensive builder, and
occupied a very prominent position in the parish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Botanic Gardens, Sloane
Street</span>.&mdash;This garden was first planned and laid out
in 1807, by Mr. Salisbury.&nbsp; The extent of ground was about
six acres, and formed a delightful promenade for company.&nbsp;
In the original plan the whole collection of plants was arranged
according to the system of Linn&aelig;us, and was disposed of in
seventeen different compartments.&nbsp; When Mr. Tate, in the
year 1820, took possession of the premises, the inhabitants,
wishing to make it a public promenade, the above arrangement was
entirely superseded, and the interior of the ground laid out and
converted into a Nursery.&nbsp; Mr. Tate, however, still devoted
the hothouses and greenhouses to the raising of curious and rare
exotics.&nbsp; Mr. Tuck, nurseryman and seedsman, is now in
possession of a portion of the ground, but the whole presents a
very different appearance to what it did many years ago.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span><span
class="smcap">The Roman Catholic Chapel</span>, situated in
Cadogan Street, was built in 1811, by voluntary
subscriptions.&nbsp; Previous to the erection of this Chapel, the
Irish poor and others in Chelsea, as well as the Roman Catholic
veterans in the Royal Hospital, had not any place to resort to on
Sundays, or at such other times as they deemed it necessary to
attend.&nbsp; Besides, there were several families in the
locality who considered the erection of the Chapel
indispensable.&nbsp; The Clergyman&rsquo;s house adjoins the
Chapel, and was built at the expense of the Rev. Abb&eacute;
Voyaux de Franous, D.D.&nbsp; On the south of Cadogan Street,
some short distance west of the Chapel, are the Convent, the
Schools, and the Burial Ground, the latter being now closed for
interments.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Upon the site of the west end of Cadogan Street stood an
ancient house, inhabited, in Bowack&rsquo;s time, by Lady
Matthews; it was afterwards known for many years as the
Marlborough Tavern and Cricket Grounds.&nbsp; It is probable that
the house was first established as a tavern during the life-time
of the great Duke of Marlborough, who, it is said, resided at one
time in Chelsea; hence Blenheim Street, &amp;c., all
contiguous.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The old Admiral Keppel Inn, with its tea gardens, was pulled
down in 1856, on the site of which is now a large tavern.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Chelsea Common</span> was called in
ancient records Chelsea Heath.&nbsp; It was bounded on the north
by the Fulham Road; on the east by Blacklands Lane, now
Marlborough Road; on the south by College Place, abutting on the
King&rsquo;s Road; and on the west by Sydney Street.&nbsp; It was
attached to the Manor.&nbsp; Certain ancient houses, cottages,
and farms, had a right of pasturage for forty cows and twenty
heifers.&nbsp; To keep these there was always a cowkeeper, whose
business it was to mark the cattle, to drive home the cows at
night to the several owners, and to impound all cattle unmarked,
or any horses which broke into the Common, or were found
there.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When the Old Church was to be rebuilt, the Common was enclosed
by the consent of Charles Cheyne, Esq., Lord of the Manor, and
the several proprietors, for 21 years, to defray part of the
charges, by a lease bearing date March 1674, and thereby let to
George Hill and Francis Guildford, who enclosed it, and quietly
enjoyed it till 1695, when it was thrown open again.&nbsp; It
would be an unnecessary waste of space to notice what took place
for some years afterwards.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>At
the commencement of the present century, however, the Lords of
the Manor, the Rector, and the other proprietors, let the Common
on building leases; after which the leases were found defective,
by reason of one of the proprietors being under age, and it being
considered that the then Rector could not bind his
successors.&nbsp; An Act of Parliament was therefore obtained,
which confirmed the leases and made them effectual.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Common (as was) has been for many years covered with
houses, comprising Keppel Street, Whitehead&rsquo;s Grove,
College Street, Marlborough Square, Leader Street, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The principal entrance to the Brompton County Court is in
Whitehead&rsquo;s Grove.&nbsp; The house was formerly occupied by
the Rev. Dr. Roberts, who gave instruction to a limited number of
young gentlemen who resided with him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Catholic Apostolic Church is situated in College Street,
near to Whitehead&rsquo;s Grove.&nbsp; The exterior has some
claim to architectural design, although the entrance at the side
is small, and there are no windows to give relief to its massive
appearance.&nbsp; There is ample light, however, in the interior
of the structure, and it is in every respect commodious.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The spacious Drill Hall belonging to the 1st Middlesex
Engineer Volunteers is also in College Street, near to the Fulham
Road, where recruits are enlisted.</p>
<h3>MARLBOROUGH CHAPEL.</h3>
<p>The old saying, &ldquo;Where there is a will there is a
way,&rdquo; was never more clearly exemplified than in the
erection of this chapel, which occupies the northern corner of
Marlborough Square, and fully warrants the inscription engraven
on its summit, &ldquo;This is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, it is
marvellous in our eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The necessity of having a
place of worship in the Methodist connexion had long been felt by
many in the neighbourhood, and a room was consequently taken in
Pond Place, but as it proved unsuitable for the purpose, Mr.
Cripps, of Keppel Street, was induced to open his large workshop
for a Thursday evening service, and having obtained a minister
from the Hinde Street <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Circuit to preach the first sermon,
was amply repaid for his kindness by a very crowded and attentive
congregation.&nbsp; Mr. Hunt, an active and zealous member,
commenced a class on the following Sunday afternoon, which
increased so rapidly as to make him extremely anxious for the
purchase of a spot of ground for a chapel, and after many
disappointments, and much discouragement, succeeded in obtaining
the present site.&nbsp; The difficulty of raising funds for its
erection was a subject of great moment, but, on communicating
with many friends, their offers of assistance were so numerous,
and accompanied with such generosity, that all doubt as to the
result was at once removed.&nbsp; In a few weeks promises were
made, and fulfilled, of all kinds of materials for its erection,
both externally and internally, and, aided by the gratuitous
labours of many devoted followers, was completed and opened July
30, 1849, about five months from its commencement.&nbsp; It is a
neat and commodious structure, and will hold about 400
persons.&nbsp; It has lately undergone several alterations and
improvements.&nbsp; There is an excellent Sunday School attached
to the chapel, at which there is an average attendance of nearly
300 children.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Brompton District Letter Sorting Post Office is situated
nearly opposite to the northern side of St. Luke&rsquo;s
Cemetery.&nbsp; It was erected a few years ago, and is well
adapted and arranged for the intended purposes.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Near to Sydney Street, and to the north of St. Luke&rsquo;s
Church, was formerly situated a solitary small house, known as
Cock&rsquo;s Hall.&nbsp; It was said to have been built by
Captain Cock, a petty officer in the Royal Hospital.&nbsp; On a
stone in the front of it was an inscription, &ldquo;Built in
1710, rebuilt in 1767.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Dr. Biber, author of &ldquo;The Life of Pestalozzi,&rdquo; and
editor of the <i>John Bull</i> newspaper, resided for some time
in Sydney Street, as did also Thomas Wright, Esq., the antiquary
and historical writer.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Henry Warren, Esq., President of the New Society of Water
Colour Painters, resided for some time opposite St. Luke&rsquo;s
Church, and at a subsequent period at the corner of Church
Street, which house has been recently pulled down.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>From
the periodical publications of the time, and from other sources,
it appears the following persons have resided in this parish at
various periods:&mdash;</p>
<p>Robert Ratcliffe, the first Earl of Sussex of that family, and
Lord High Chamberlain of England, died at his palace at Chelsea,
November 26, 1542.</p>
<p>Robert Viscount Fitzwalter was created Earl of Sussex by Henry
VIII. in 1527.&nbsp; He married first, Elizabeth, daughter of
Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham; secondly, Margaret, daughter
of Thomas, Earl of Derby; thirdly, Mary, daughter of Sir John
Arundel.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John Pym, a distinguished Member of the House of Commons,
resided at Chelsea for several years. <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a>&nbsp; He was Member for Tavistock, and
was a remarkable instance of what wonders, strength of parts, and
force of eloquence, could effect.&nbsp; His influence was
superior to authority, but by many he was thought to have made a
very bad use of power; his intent was to reform, not to abolish
the Government; and yet he was a principal engine in bringing
about a revolution, which he never intended, and which he did not
live to see; he died December 8, 1643.&nbsp; His excessive
application to public affairs is supposed to have hastened his
death.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a man,&rdquo; says Hume, &ldquo;as
much hated by one party as respected by the other.&nbsp; At
London, he was considered as the victim of national liberty, who
had abridged his life by incessant labours for the interest of
his country.&nbsp; At Oxford, he was believed to have been struck
with an uncommon disease, and to have been consumed with vermin,
as a mark of Divine vengeance for his multiplied crimes and
treasons.&nbsp; He had been so little studious of improving his
private fortune in those civil wars, of which he had been one
principal author, that the Parliament thought themselves obliged
from gratitude to pay the debts which he had
contracted.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Count D&rsquo;Estrades, who came to England to negociate the
sale of Dunkirk, as ambassador from Lewis XIV., resided at
Chelsea during the years 1661 and 1662.&nbsp; This fact appears
by the dates of his letters, of which a translation appeared in
1755.&nbsp; He had his first audience of his Majesty King Charles
II. on the 27th of July of the former year.&nbsp; It was usual
for the Foreign Ambassadors at that time to make their public
entry <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>from the Tower of London, but on this occasion the King
sent his own coaches to Chelsea, to carry the Ambassador, and the
Count was accompanied by the equipages of the whole of the
diplomatic corps at that time in London.</p>
<p>Count D&rsquo;Estrades was invited by letters from the
Chancellor himself, in order to conclude the bargain;
&pound;900,000 were demanded, &pound;100,000 were offered.&nbsp;
By degrees the English lowered their demands, and the French
raised their offers.&nbsp; The bargain was concluded at
&pound;400,000.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Sir Robert Atkyns, either Chief Baron of the Exchequer, or his
son, the historian of Gloucestershire, appears by the Parish
Books to have resided in Chelsea in 1684.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Atkyns, K.B., was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer
under William III., which office he held with distinguished
ability and integrity.&nbsp; This gentleman, by his influence,
promoted the Revolution, and by his pen defended it in tracts
replete with legal knowledge.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hon. Colonel Rieutort died at his house, Chelsea, on the
24th January, 1725&ndash;6, in his 66th year.&nbsp; He was born
of a good family, at Montpelier, in France, where he early bore
arms; and, having left his native country, on account of the
Protestant religion, he attended William III. in the wars of
Ireland.&nbsp; He afterwards served the Crown of Great Britain in
Piedmont; and in 1703 assisted Count de Frise in the vigorous
defence of Landau, then besieged by the French.&nbsp; In 1704, he
went into Portugal with the Earl of Galway, who sent him to the
relief of the Prince of Hesse, then closely beset in Gibraltar,
where he contributed very much to the preservation of that
important place.&nbsp; He was interred in Chelsea Church.</p>
<h3>THE CANCER HOSPITAL.</h3>
<p>This hospital is situated in the Fulham Road, almost facing
the Consumption Hospital.&nbsp; The ceremony of laying the
foundation stone was performed on Monday, May 30, 1859, by Miss
Burdett Coutts, in the presence of a very numerous and
respectable company, including Dr. Tait, Bishop of London,
Archdeacon Sinclair, Rev. D. Coleridge, Rev. J. B. Owen, the Rev.
Fathers Ballard and Bagshawe, Priests of the Oratory, at
Brompton, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>The
Rev. Thomas Pearson commenced the proceedings with prayer, after
which the Bishop of London addressed the assemblage, and said
they were met to lay the foundation stone of a most excellent
institution, destined to bestow great blessings on a large
portion of the community&mdash;a house for the reception of
persons afflicted with a most painful disease, demanding the
greatest sympathy from all friends of humanity.&nbsp; His
Lordship, at the close of his address, prayed for its permanency
and success.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Miss Coutts having deposited the bottle, with the usual
contents, in a cavity in the lower stone and spread the mortar,
the upper stone was duly lowered into its place, after which Miss
Coutts gave the customary knocks and declared the stone duly
laid.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Rev. J. B. Owen next addressed the assembly, after which
John Abel Smith, Esq., proposed thanks to Miss Coutts for having
done them the honour of laying the foundation stone of the
hospital.&nbsp; The Bishop of London said that he had been
requested by Miss Coutts to acknowledge the compliment paid her,
and to assure them that she should continue to take the greatest
interest in the prosperity of the Institution.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The building has a frontage of 130 ft. and a depth of 50 ft.,
surrounded by an area of 10 ft., securing to the building the
means of convenient external communication and ventilation.&nbsp;
It is constructed of plain white Suffolk bricks, relieved with
bands of red brick, keystones, and cornices of stone
dressing.&nbsp; The lower story contains the kitchens, larders,
and the rooms for the out-patients.&nbsp; The principal ground
floor is approached by a flight of steps, and this contains the
hall and a handsome staircase of stone, apartments for the
house-surgeon and medical officers, and wards for patients.&nbsp;
Apparatus for heating and ventilating the building is
provided&mdash;everything, in short, that is calculated to add to
the comforts and assist the recovery of the patients.&nbsp; On
the first story are the wards.&nbsp; In the males it appears this
direful disease shows itself more frequently in the face, lip,
and tongue, and among some of them in the breast.&nbsp; Of the
females nearly five-sixths suffer in the breast.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The building, in all its details, has been open about six
years.&nbsp; It was erected from the design of David Mocatta,
Esq., by Messrs. Lawrence, at a cost of &pound;7,000.&nbsp;
William Marsden, M.D. was the founder.</p>
<h3><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>HOSPITAL FOR CONSUMPTION.</h3>
<p>This is another admirable Institution, and, although it is
situated just beyond the boundary of Chelsea parish, on the north
of the Fulham Road, it has a very strong claim to be noticed in
this work.&nbsp; It is a beautiful Elizabethan structure, built
in the shape of the letter H, the depth of each wing being 190
ft., and the width of the building 200 ft.&nbsp; It stands in a
square piece of ground covering three acres, and faces the public
road.&nbsp; On entering the Lodge-gate there are three broad
drives, one to the central entrance, which opens to a cheerful
hall upon the first floor; another to the east entrance, which
leads to the offices for the transaction of the hospital
business; and the third to the west entrance, which is for the
use of inmates and the friends of the in-patients on visiting
days.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The ground floor is on a level with the gardens.&nbsp; The
west wing and part of the centre of this floor contain the
Dispensary and Out-patient-rooms, Laboratory, Museum, and
Sitting-rooms of the Resident Clinical Assistants.&nbsp; The east
wing contains the apartments of the Resident Medical Officer and
Matron, Linen-room, Store-room, Secretary&rsquo;s Office,
Board-room, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first floor is devoted exclusively to Female Patients,
saving small rooms for the Chaplain, and for each of the two Head
Nurses, and the two requisite Sculleries, Baths, and
Lavatories.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The arrangements of the second floor are precisely the same as
those on the first floor; the wards being occupied by Male
Patients, for whom there are about 107 beds.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The attic floor has comfortable dormitories for the Nurses and
Servants, and in the Tower-rooms are the sleeping apartments of
the Resident Clinical Assistants.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Chapel stands on the north side of the hospital, and
parallel with the centre portion.&nbsp; The approach is by a
corridor opposite the front entrance, to which the patients have
immediate access from their respective galleries.&nbsp; The
chaplain is the Rev. E. B. Allen, B.A., whose faithful
exhortations and kind manner of addressing the patients have
gained for him the esteem of all who know his worth.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>His late R.H. the Prince Consort laid the foundation stone of
the hospital in 1844.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span><span
class="smcap">The Home</span>.&mdash;This Institution is
conducted and maintained by a few benevolent Ladies, as an
auxiliary to the above hospital, for persons who are either
waiting their turns for admission to the hospital, or after
leaving it, during the necessary time occupied in the full
re-establishment of their health and their search for
employment.&nbsp; This excellent &ldquo;Home&rdquo; is at Manor
House, near Durham Place, Chelsea.</p>
<h3>CHELSEA IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>
<p>The Metropolitan Board of Works (Loans) Bill, empowering the
Metropolitan Board of Works to raise money to construct the
Chelsea Embankment, and to effect other improvements, having
received the Royal assent, there is now no doubt that the Chelsea
Embankment works will be very shortly commenced.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Bills for the &ldquo;Belgrave Market,&rdquo; which will
remove the unsightly block of buildings between Turk&rsquo;s Row
and Jew&rsquo;s Row, and the &ldquo;Belgravia and South
Kensington New Road,&rdquo; which will open a direct
communication from Eaton Square to the South Kensington Museum,
have also become law.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The works of the Albert Bridge are still suspended, but there
is reason to hope that they will shortly be recommenced, and
rapidly completed.</p>
<h3>FIRST ELECTION OF MEMBERS FOR THE BOROUGH OF CHELSEA.</h3>
<p>I will now endeavour to record a few impartial particulars
respecting the proceedings on the day of election, with the
ultimate state of the poll, when the two first members for the
Borough of Chelsea were elected.&nbsp; The nomination took place
on Tuesday, the 17th of November, 1868, and the election on the
following day.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>The
hustings were erected in an open and central place near the South
Kensington Museum, and was capable of holding about 200 or 300
persons.&nbsp; C. A. Bannister, Esq., of Chelsea, was the
Returning Officer, and he performed his duty with the utmost
courtesy and fairness.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The candidates originally were C. Wentworth Dilke, Esq., <a
name="citation223"></a><a href="#footnote223"
class="citation">[223]</a> Sir Henry Hoare, Dr. Russell, and C.
J. Freake, Esq.&nbsp; Mr. Odger, a working man, who was warmly
supported by a large number of the constituency, retired previous
to the nomination from what may be fairly considered the most
honourable motives.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>R. Freeman, Esq., of Kensington, proposed Mr. C. W. Dilke, and
John Boyd, Esq., of Argyll House, King&rsquo;s Road, seconded the
nomination.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Wingfield Baker, Esq., proposed Sir H. A. Hoare, and James
Heywood, Esq., seconded.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Hon. E. C. Curzon proposed Mr. Freake, and the Hon. Capt.
Maude seconded the nomination.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>General Sir A. S. Wangle proposed Dr. Russell, and Captain
Morley seconded.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The show of hands was then taken, and there being a large
majority for Mr. C. W. Dilke and Sir H. A. Hoare, the two liberal
candidates, a poll was demanded on behalf of Dr. Russell and Mr.
Freake, which took place on the following day, the 18th of
November, 1868.&nbsp; The proceedings were of the most orderly
character, generally speaking, at all the thirteen polling
booths.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The state of the poll was declared to be as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Dilke</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">7,357</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Hoare</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">7,183</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Russell</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">4,177</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Freake</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">3,929</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>About 2,000 persons were present, and the four candidates with
their friends.</p>
<h3><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>SINGULAR ASCENT IN THE CAPTIVE BALLOON.</h3>
<p>A female inmate of St. George&rsquo;s Workhouse, Fulham Road,
named Hogg, having completed her hundredth year, August 3, 1869,
was asked by Mr. Godrich, the medical officer, if, at her
advanced age, there was any particular wish he could
gratify.&nbsp; Her reply was that she should like to go up in the
balloon, and see the world once more.&nbsp; Arrangements were
made for the following Thursday, and, accompanied by the Matron
and a few of Mr. Godrich&rsquo;s friends, they ascended, and
after enjoying themselves for some considerable time descended
quite safely, the centenarian expressing herself much delighted
with the aerial trip.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
